** Background
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: background
   :END:

Formed from wood pulp or plant fiber, paper is chiefly used for written
communication. The earliest paper was papyrus, made from reeds by the
ancient Egyptians. Paper was made by the Chinese in the second century,
probably by a Chinese court official named Cai Lun. His paper was made
from such things as tree bark and old fish netting. Recognized almost
immediately as a valuable secret, it was 500 years before the Japanese
acquired knowledge of the method. Papermaking was known in the Islamic
world from the end of the eighth century A.D.

Knowledge of papermaking eventually moved westward, and the first
European paper mill was built at Jativa, in the province of Valencia,
Spain, in about 1150. By the end of the 15th century, paper mills
existed in Italy, France, Germany, and England, and by the end of the
16th century, paper was being made throughout Europe.

Paper, whether produced in the modern factory or by the most careful,
delicate hand methods, is made up of connected fibers. The fibers can
come from a number of sources including cloth rags, cellulose fibers
from plants, and, most notably, trees. The use of cloth in the process
has always produced high-quality paper. Today, a large proportion of
cotton and linen fibers in the mix create many excellent papers for
special uses, from wedding invitation paper stock to special paper for
pen and ink drawings.

The method of making paper is essentially a simple one---mix up
vegetable fibers, and cook them in hot water until the fibers are soft
but not dissolved. The hot water also contains a base chemical such as
lye, which softens the fibers as they are cooking. Then, pass a
screen-like material through the mixture, let the water drip off and/or
evaporate, and then squeeze or blot out additional water. A layer of
paper is left behind. Essential to the process are the fibers, which are
never totally destroyed, and, when mixed and softened, form an
interlaced pattern within the paper itself. Modern papermaking methods,
although significantly more complicated than the older ways, are
developmental improvements rather than entirely new methods of making
paper.

** Raw Materials
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: raw-materials
   :END:

Probably half of the fiber used for paper today comes from wood that has
been purposely harvested. The remaining material comes from wood fiber
from sawmills, recycled *newspaper,* some vegetable matter, and recycled
cloth. Coniferous trees, such as spruce and fir, used to be preferred
for papermaking because the cellulose fibers in the pulp of these
species are longer, therefore making for stronger paper. These trees are
called "softwood" by the paper industry. Deciduous trees (leafy trees
such as poplar and elm) are called "hardwood." Because of increasing
demand for paper, and improvements in pulp processing technology, almost
any species of tree can now be harvested for paper.

Some plants other than trees are suitable for paper-making. In areas
without significant forests, bamboo has been used for paper pulp, as has
straw and sugarcane. Flax,

[[../images/hpm_0000_0002_0_img0155.jpg]]

Most paper is made by a mechanical or chemical process.

hemp, and jute fibers are commonly used for textiles and
rope making, but they can also be used for
paper. Some high-grade cigarette paper
is made from flax.
Cotton and linen rags are used in fine-grade papers such as letterhead
and resume paper, and for bank notes and security certificates. The rags
are usually cuttings and waste from textile and garment mills. The rags
must be cut and cleaned, boiled, and beaten before they can be used by
the paper mill.

Other materials used in paper manufacture include bleaches and dyes,
fillers such as chalk, clay, or titanium oxide, and sizings such as
rosin, gum, and starch.

** The Manufacturing\\
Process
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-manufacturing-process
   :END:

*** /Making pulp/
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: making-pulp
    :END:

- 1 Several processes are commonly used to convert logs to wood pulp. In
  the mechanical process, logs are first tumbled in drums to remove the
  bark. The logs are then sent to grinders, which break the wood down
  into pulp by pressing it between huge revolving slabs. The pulp is
  filtered to remove foreign objects. In the chemical process, wood
  chips from de-barked logs are cooked in a chemical solution. This is
  done in huge vats called digesters. The chips are fed into the
  digester, and then boiled at high pressure in a solution of

  [[../images/hpm_0000_0002_0_img0156.jpg]]

  sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide. The chips dissolve into pulp in
  the solution. Next the pulp is sent through filters. *Bleach* may be
  added at this stage, or colorings. The pulp is sent to the paper
  plant.

*** /Beating/
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: beating
    :END:

- 2 The pulp is next put through a pounding and squeezing process
  called, appropriately enough, beating. Inside a large tub, the pulp is
  subjected to the effect of machine beaters. At this point, various
  filler materials can be added such as chalks, clays, or chemicals such
  as titanium oxide. These additives will influence the opacity and
  other qualities of the final product. Sizings are also added at this
  point. Sizing affects the way the paper will react with various inks.
  Without any sizing at all, a paper will be too absorbent for most uses
  except as a desk blotter. A sizing such as starch makes the paper
  resistant to water-based ink (inks actually sit on top of a sheet of
  paper, rather than sinking in). A variety of sizings, generally rosins
  and gums, is available depending on the eventual use of the paper.
  Paper that will receive a printed design, such as gift wrapping,
  requires a particular formula of sizing that will make the paper
  accept the printing properly.

*** /Pulp to paper/
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pulp-to-paper
    :END:

- 3 In order to finally turn the pulp into paper, the pulp is fed or
  pumped into giant, automated machines. One common type is called the
  Fourdrinier machine, which was invented in England in 1807. Pulp is
  fed into the Fourdrinier machine on a moving belt of fine mesh
  screening. The pulp is squeezed through a series of rollers, while
  suction devices below the belt drain off water. If the paper is to
  receive a water-mark, a device called a dandy moves across the sheet
  of pulp and presses a design into it.

  The paper then moves onto the press section of the machine, where it
  is pressed between rollers of wool felt. The paper then passes over a
  series of steam-heated cylinders to remove the remaining water. A
  large machine may have from 40 to 70 drying cylinders.

*** /Finishing/
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: finishing
    :END:

- 4 Finally, the dried paper is wound onto large reels, where it will be
  further processed depending on its ultimate use. Paper is smoothed and
  compacted further by passing through metal rollers called calendars. A
  particular finish, whether soft and dull or hard and shiny, can be
  imparted by the calendars.

  The paper may be further finished by passing through a vat of sizing
  material. It may also receive a coating, which is either brushed on or
  rolled on. Coating adds chemicals or pigments to the paper's surface,
  supplementing the sizings and fillers from earlier in the process.
  Fine clay is often used as a coating. The paper may next be
  supercalendered, that is, run through extremely smooth calendar
  rollers, for a final time. Then the paper is cut to the desired size.

** Environmental Concerns
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: environmental-concerns
   :END:

The number of trees and other vegetation cut down in order to make paper
is enormous. Paper companies insist that they plant as many new trees as
they cut down. Environmentalists contend that the new growth trees, so
much younger and smaller than what was removed, cannot replace the value
of older trees. Efforts to recycle used paper (especially newspapers)
have been effective in at least partially mitigating the need for
destruction of woodlands, and recycled paper is now an important
ingredient in many types of paper production.

The chemicals used in paper manufacture, including dyes, inks, bleach,
and sizing, can also be harmful to the environment when they are
released into water supplies and nearby land after use. The industry
has, sometimes with government prompting, cleared up a large amount of
pollution, and federal requirements now demand pollutionfree paper
production. The cost of such clean-up efforts is passed on to the
consumer.

Concerning environment protection, it is necessary that for one older
tree, ten plants should be planted and the older tree should be cut down
atleast after three years when planting new plants.

Paper is essential in our life and as equally important as to computer.
Deforestation is a must in order to cater the needs for manufacturing
papers worldwide...Though stating the fact to plant trees, how much time
for a tree to grow? In case you don't know it takes up to at least
10++years. Gosh imagine how many trees been cut down during the period!
Only god knows how to stop it (unless you have a better idea on this
serious issue). It's serious isn;t it? Trees has been protecting the
earth from the Sun and avoiding the light from overheating the surface
of the Earth. Undoubtedly which is a factor towards the GLOBAL WARMING
issue nowadays.\\
\\
Having said all that, am currently researching on the related
environmental issue. Therefore, would it be better to provide a video
clip on the manufacturing of paper? I must agree that video explains
more. Thanks and sorry if i offended any parties. Have a nice day!

Johan...Sawdust is a key component in paper making if there is a wood
mill around. All the sawdust is captured in trucks or railroad cars and
is sent to the paper mill. Once there a rotary dumper picks up the train
car and turns it over to dump out the sawdust into bins that will be
used as the paper is being made.

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?\\
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb\\
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold\\
Until you find it there and lead it back home\\
\\
(Wake me up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(I can't wake up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(Save me)\\
Call my name and save me from the dark\\
(Wake me up)\\
Bid my blood to run\\
(I can't wake up)\\
Before I come undone\\
(Save me)\\
Save me from the nothing I've become\\
\\
Now that I know what I'm without\\
You can't just leave me\\
Breathe into me and make me real\\
Bring me to life\\
\\
(Wake me up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(I can't wake up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(Save me)\\
Call my name and save me from the dark\\

(I can't wake up)\\
Before I come undone\\
(Save me)\\
Save me from the nothing I've become\\
\\
Bring me to life\\
(I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside)\\
Bring me to life\\
\\
Frozen inside without your touch\\
Without your love, darling\\
Only you are the life among the dead\\
\\
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see\\
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me\\
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems\\
Got to open my eyes to everything\\
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul\\
Don't let me die here\\
There must be something more\\
Bring me to life\\
\\
(Wake me up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(I can't wake up)\\
Wake me up inside\\
(Save me)\\
Call my name and save me from the dark\\
(Wake me up)\\
Bid my blood to run\\
(I can't wake up)\\
Before I come undone\\
(Save me)\\
Save me from the nothing I've become\\

The Bee Movie

[[javascript:void(0);][[[/images/comment.moderate.gif]]]]

Jan 15, 2019 @ 10:10 am

Bee Movie Script\\
\\
\\
According to all known laws\\
of aviation,\\
\\
\\
there is no way a bee\\
should be able to fly.\\
\\
\\
Its wings are too small to get\\
its fat little body off the ground.\\
\\
\\
The bee, of course, flies anyway\\
\\
\\
because bees don't care\\
what humans think is impossible.\\
\\
\\
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.\\
Yellow, black. Yellow, black.\\
\\
\\
Ooh, black and yellow!\\
Let's shake it up a little.\\
\\
\\
Barry! Breakfast is ready!\\
\\
\\
Ooming!\\
\\
\\
Hang on a second.\\
\\
\\
Hello?\\
\\
\\
- Barry?\\
- Adam?\\
\\
\\
- Oan you believe this is happening?\\
- I can't. I'll pick you up.\\
\\
\\
Looking sharp.\\
\\
\\
Use the stairs. Your father\\
paid good money for those.\\
\\
\\
Sorry. I'm excited.\\
\\
\\
Here's the graduate.\\
We're very proud of you, son.\\
\\
\\
A perfect report card, all B's.\\
\\
\\
Very proud.\\
\\
\\
Ma! I got a thing going here.\\
\\
\\
- You got lint on your fuzz.\\
- Ow! That's me!\\
\\
\\
- Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.\\
- Bye!\\
\\
\\
Barry, I told you,\\
stop flying in the house!\\
\\
\\
- Hey, Adam.\\
- Hey, Barry.\\
\\
\\
- Is that fuzz gel?\\
- A little. Special day, graduation.\\
\\
\\
Never thought I'd make it.\\
\\
\\
Three days grade school,\\
three days high school.\\
\\
\\
Those were awkward.\\
\\
\\
Three days college. I'm glad I took\\
a day and hitchhiked around the hive.\\
\\
\\
You did come back different.\\
\\
\\
- Hi, Barry.\\
- Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.\\
\\
\\
- Hear about Frankie?\\
- Yeah.\\
\\
\\
- You going to the funeral?\\
- No, I'm not going.\\
\\
\\
Everybody knows,\\
sting someone, you die.\\
\\
\\
Don't waste it on a squirrel.\\
Such a hothead.\\
\\
\\
I guess he could have\\
just gotten out of the way.\\
\\
\\
I love this incorporating\\
an amusement park into our day.\\
\\
\\
That's why we don't need vacations.\\
\\
\\
Boy, quite a bit of pomp...\\
under the circumstances.\\
\\
\\
- Well, Adam, today we are men.\\
- We are!\\
\\
\\
- Bee-men.\\
- Amen!\\
\\
\\
Hallelujah!\\
\\
\\
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,\\
\\
\\
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.\\
\\
\\
Welcome, New Hive Oity\\
graduating class of...\\
\\
\\
...9:15.\\
\\
\\
That concludes our ceremonies.\\
\\
\\
And begins your career\\
at Honex Industries!\\
\\
\\
Will we pick ourjob today?\\
\\
\\
I heard it's just orientation.\\
\\
\\
Heads up! Here we go.\\
\\
\\
Keep your hands and antennas\\
inside the tram at all times.\\
\\
\\
- Wonder what it'll be like?\\
- A little scary.\\
\\
\\
Welcome to Honex,\\
a division of Honesco\\
\\
\\
and a part of the Hexagon Group.\\
\\
\\
This is it!\\
\\
\\
Wow.\\
\\
\\
Wow.\\
\\
\\
We know that you, as a bee,\\
have worked your whole life\\
\\
\\
to get to the point where you\\
can work for your whole life.\\
\\
\\
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen\\
Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.\\
\\
\\
Our top-secret formula\\
\\
\\
is automatically color-corrected,\\
scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured\\
\\
\\
into this soothing sweet syrup\\
\\
\\
with its distinctive\\
golden glow you know as...\\
\\
\\
Honey!\\
\\
\\
- That girl was hot.\\
- She's my cousin!\\
\\
\\
- She is?\\
- Yes, we're all cousins.\\
\\
\\
- Right. You're right.\\
- At Honex, we constantly strive\\
\\
\\
to improve every aspect\\
of bee existence.\\
\\
\\
These bees are stress-testing\\
a new helmet technology.\\
\\
\\
- What do you think he makes?\\
- Not enough.\\
\\
\\
Here we have our latest advancement,\\
the Krelman.\\
\\
\\
- What does that do?\\
- Oatches that little strand of honey\\
\\
\\
that hangs after you pour it.\\
Saves us millions.\\
\\
\\
Oan anyone work on the Krelman?\\
\\
\\
Of course. Most bee jobs are\\
small ones. But bees know\\
\\
- Hi, bee.\\
- He's back here!
