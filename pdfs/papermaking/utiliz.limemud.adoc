Abstract: The utilization of lime-mud as a filler in paper making was
studied. The
lime – mud before and after treatment were characterized using laser
scattering
particle size distribution technique. The dregs and alkali metal losses
were removed.
The final samples were grinded to achieve the proper particle size.
Finally, the treated
lime-mud was applied in the research plant as filler on paper sheets.


Keywords: Lime-mud, particle size, filler, paper making.

1. INTRODUCTION
Pulp and paper industry is a source of a
wide range of solid inorganic and organic
wastes generated during the various processes
in bleached Kraft production. Waste handling
receives a great concern in pulp and paper
industrial plants either by minimizing the
generation of this waste or to reuse it,
whenever practicable.
Bagasse, the most fibrous raw material
available and suitable for paper making in
Egypt, is the sugarcane residue after sugar
extraction. The ultimate goal of chemical
pulping is to liberate cellulosic fibers by
(delignification) without
lignin
degrading or
fibers. Alkaline
pulping processes are not totally selective for
lignin, and cellulose is degraded by the
cooking liquor [1].
In the Kraft pulping process, bagasse

liquor” composed
mainly of sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide
(Na2S). This mixing occurs in a “digester”
vessel at a
temperature and pressure
satisfactory to separate the cellulosic fiber
from the natural lignins that bind such
fibers. The dead load chemicals have no
direct effect on pulping. An increase in dead
load can result in a decrease in lignin
removal in pulping [2].
The liberated fiber is separated from the
resultant ˝black liquor˝ and is subsequently
washed,
and
eventually transformed into paper. Washing
filters remove the maximum amount of
diisolved organic and soluble
inorganic
material present with pulp mass to prevent
any
or
papermaking chemicals [3].

The separated black liquor contains, aside
from the original white liquor chemicals,

recover and recycle these costly pulping
chemicals, as well as to produce valuable pulp
mill steam and power from the contained
organic
is
concentrated in multiple-effect evaporators
and delivered as a concentrated fuel to a
“chemical recovery boiler.”
This recovery boiler combusts the organics
under unique oxidizing/reducing conditions to
a molten inorganic ash (“smelt”) consisting
primarily of Na2S and Na2CO3. The co-
produced high-pressure steam is subsequently
exhausted via a steam turbine/generator to
produce mill power and lower pressure mill
process steams [6]. The smelt is drained from
the recovery boiler and quenched in water to
create the “green liquor.” This green liquor is

Lime-mud obtained from the recovery
plant was dried and then the alkali loss was
measured. It was subjected to full chemical
analysis, particle size determination and
optical properties. The study included the
effect of washing with hot water at different
temperatures on the removal of alkali and
dissolved silica then full chemical analysis
was conducted. The effect of grinding on
the particle size distribution using constant
volume and changing the time of grinding
was also investigated. The optical properties

b. Washing of lime-mud to remove alkali

Table 2 shows that the chemical loss of
Na2O decreases from 1.45% to 0.55% which
then becomes more suitable for paper
making. From Tables 1 & 2, it is clear that
washing leads to lowering of the alkali and
soluble silica.

Table 3 shows a small increase in 2µm

without treatment, and high increase in 2µm
portion with grinding lime- mud samples
after washing, drying and grinding in order
to soften the particles size, in comparison
with CaCO3 filler sample. These facts are
depicted in Fig. 1.

Conclusion

Tests made in this study showed that
lime-mud after washing and drying is an
important source of crude carbonate which
(due its chemical properties and natural
potential) can be used in paper making
industry as a filler in coated paper with the
following superior properties:

 Some chemical contents and dregs

were removed.

 Brightness is suitable for papermaking.

Lime-mud particles size becomes smaller
and percent of 2 µm (15.0%) increases
gradually with increasing time reaching
71.7 % and thus becomes the carbonate
more suitable for paper making.
