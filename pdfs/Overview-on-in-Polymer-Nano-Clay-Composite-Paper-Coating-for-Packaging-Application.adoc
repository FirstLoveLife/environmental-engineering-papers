Abstract +

This is a review of the existing studies on the Polymer/ clay nano
composite used for improving water and moisture +
barrier in coating. Clays have been and continue to be one of the more
important industrial minerals. Research and +
development activities by clay scientists in academia, government, and
industry are continually resulting in new and +
innovative clay products many of these new applications are the result
of improved processing which provides clays +
of higher purity, more precise particle size and distribution, whiter
and brighter color, modified surface chemistry, and +
other physical and chemical modifications. Some new and improved clay
products include tailored or engineered +
paper coating kaolins, nanocomposites for plastics etc. The use of
mineral pigments in coating to provide improved +
barrier properties has recently gaining increased attention. I described
the use of Polymer nano clay for improving the +
barrier properties of the coated paper studied by several researchers. +

Introduction +

The paper packaging industry is one of the growing industries +
due to an increasing demand for packaging products in the market. +
In addition, market competition often forces companies, especially +
in market of consumer products, to enhance the packaging in order +
to improve the image of their products and by this attract more +
consumers to buy them. Paper coating, which is one way to enhance +
the packaging, is a process where a coating film is applied onto paper +
to impart certain qualities to the paper, including weight, surface
gloss, +
smoothness and protection. The coating materials widely used are thin +
laminated-plastic films or liquid polymeric coat. Without coatings, +
paper does not have the strength, gloss, printability or resistance to +
grease and moisture that is required in most of these growth areas
[1]. +
The term “clay” refers to a naturally occurring material composed +
primarily of fine-grained minerals, which is generally appropriate +
water contents and will harden with dried or fired. Although clay +
usually contains phyllosilicates, it may contain other materials that +
impart plasticity and harden when dried or fired [2]. Associated
phases +
in clay may include materials that do not impart plasticity and
organic +
matter. Clays have been and continue to be one of the more important +
industrial minerals. Clays and clay minerals are widely utilized in +
many facets of our society. They are important in geology,
agriculture, +
construction, engineering, process industries, and environmental +
applications. Traditional applications are many. Some of the more +
important include ceramics, paper, paint, plastics, drilling fluids, +
foundry bondants, chemical carriers, liquid barriers, decolorization, +
and catalysis Kaolin is one of the most widely used pigments in paper +
industry and exploited in a large range of coating applications [3].
Fine +
secondary kaolin’s are used for good gloss because of their smaller +
particle size. In general, platy kaolin particles carry out good
coating +
opacity and printability [4,5] Kaolin has a layered structure, which
is +
composed so that (0 0 1) crystal plane is parallel to the surface of
kaolin +
particle (Table 1). +
Nanocomposite Properties +

Polymer composites are mixtures of polymers with inorganic or +
organic additives having certain geometries (fibers, flakes, spheres, +

particulates). The use of nanoscale fillers is leading to the
development +
of polymer nanocomposites and represents a radical alternative to +
these conventional polymer composites [6-8]. This new generation +
of composites exhibits significant +
in modulus, +
dimensional stability and solvent or gas resistance with respect to
the +
pristine polymer. Nanocomposites also offer extra benefits like low +
density, good flow, better surface properties and recyclability. It is +
worth recalling that all these improvements are obtained at very low +
filler contents (generally lower than 5%) [6]. +

materials. The inorganic particles have at least one dimension in the +
nanometer (from 1 to 100 nm) range. It means that a uniform dispersion +
of these particles can lead to ultra-large interfacial area between
the +
constituents. The very large organic/inorganic interface alters the +
molecular mobility, the relaxation behavior and the consequent +
thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposite +
material. +

Various inorganic nano-particles have been recognized as possible +
additives to enhance the polymer performance. Some examples of these +
particles are represented by the solid layered, the synthetic polymer +
nano-fibers, the cellulose nano-whiskers and the carbon nanotube. +
Among these, up to now only the layered inorganic solids like clay
have +
attracted some attention by the packaging industry. This is not only +
due to their availability and low cost but also due to their
significant +
enhancements and relative simple process ability. The first successful +
example of a polymer–clay hybrid, developed at Toyota Central +
Research Laboratories in 1986 was a nylon–clay hybrid (Figure 1) [9]. +
Packaging Application +

Paper and paperboard are coated in order to improve their optical +
properties and printability. Paper coating formulations generally +
consist of inorganic pigments such as kaolin and calcium carbonate, +
binder, soluble co-binders, dispersants, water as carrier and other +
additives. Pigment is the abundant component in the coating and is +
naturally the most important factor affecting the properties of the +
coating materials [10]. The use of mineral pigments in dispersion +
coating to provide improved barrier properties has recently gaining +
increased attention [11-16]. Important physical or chemical properties +
of the pigments which affect the water vapor permeability are their +
aspect ratio, particle size distribution and hydrophilic/hydrophobic +
character found that a narrow particle size distribution and a large +
aspect ratio both had a positive effect on the barrier properties of
talc- +
filled dispersion-coated paper substrates [11-13]. Talc pigments in
the +
polymer coatings were also shown by to give slightly lower water vapor +
transmission rates (WVTR) than kaolin clays [17,18]. +
Improving Water and Moisture Barrier in Coating +

Polymer–clay nanocomposites, with +

fully-exfoliated platelet +
structure of nanoclay dispersed within a polymer matrix, provide +
excellent mechanical and barrier performances due to the high surface- +
to-volume ratio of the nanofiller and the increased tortuosity of the +
diffusion path against the permeant [19-23]. The modification of the +
clay by intercalating cationic surfactants into its interlayer space
allows +
the entry of hydrophobic monomer or polymer into the organophilic +

intergalleries. The in situ polymerization of monomer within the clay +
interspacing causes the expansion and exfoliation of the nanoclay +
platelets [24,25]. Although many polymer–nanoclay composites have +
been developed, it is generally accepted that a strong mechanical +
force, such as delamination and extrusion, is needed to help polymer +
molecules penetrating into the nanoclay basal interspacing. +

Barrier coating is one of the most important properties for paper +
packaging containers. The conventional barrier boards for water vapor, +
grease and oxygen-proofing applications have been developed based +
on the extrusion products of a range of polymers, such as polyethylene +
(PE), poly (ethyl terephthalate) (PET), or natural wax as well
Recently, +
aqueous-based polymers have come into use in many on-machine or +
off-machine coatings, due to their environmentally friendly process +
and easy to use, in comparison with the conventional extruding +
machine coating processes. There are some challenges in improving +
barrier coating efficiency using water-based nanoclay composite +
suspensions. For example, the nanoclay particles must be colloidally +
stable in the suspension and the clay particles must be exfoliated in +
the final polymer matrix. The former requires a high hydrophilic +
surface of the clay so the clay can be well dispersed in water phase
but +
the latter requires a high hydrophobicity so the polymer can diffuse +
into the intergalleries between clay plates. Furthermore, the nanoclay +
particles must possess strong affinity to polymer to avoid interior +
defects formation in hindering the diffusion of permeants through +
the coating layer. In conventional polymer composites, the micron- +
sized fillers, for example, kaolin with particle size up to a few
microns, +
are immiscible with polymer matrix, leading to a coarsely blended +
composite with chemically distinct phases. The poor compatibility +
causes a poor physical attraction between the organic and inorganic +
components, resulting in agglomeration, and therefore, weaker +
mechanical properties, and thus low barrier resistance at the same +
process conditions [26]. +
Moisture barrier coatings containing clay +

Moisture barriers are frequently applied to paper wrappers or +
paperboard to protect food products and to corrugated paperboard in +
order to withstand high humidity storage conditions. In the latter
case, +
it is important to prolong the lifetime of the packaging box by
resisting +
creep failure. Barriers can be applied to a substrate such as
paperboard +
by extrusion coating, lamination or dispersion coating techniques. The +
latter has recently gained much interest as a low cost alternative
with +
many benefits [27-33]. Moisture barrier dispersion coatings have a +
competitive advantage over wax based coatings, laminates or extruded +
products in recyclability and higher application speeds as well as +
fewer processing steps. Barrier dispersion coatings being more readily +
compostable and repulpable are far more environmentally friendly +
than extrusion coatings or laminated boards where recovery of the +
fibres and disposal of polymer film and/or wax represent a significant +
cost impost. In some food applications, the use of coatings that are
free +
of fluorine containing compounds is also of interest. The two most +
attractive reasons for using barrier dispersion coatings are lower
cost +
and the ability to use conventional coating techniques. The barrier +
dispersion coatings studied by C. Kugge based on styrene–butadiene +
latex and clay, with latex solid ratios of less than one; the coatings
are +
transparent and clay acts as filler in a polymeric matrix. This
situation +
compares with conventional paper coatings where the pigment to latex +
ratio is greater than one and the latex functions as a binder. +

Clay and Polymer Matrix Varieties on the Barrier +
Properties +

The mechanism to increase the barrier properties of materials +
from nanoclay is based on the increase in the tortuous length of the +
diffusion path through a polymer matrix. Because nanoclay has much +
greater specific surface area than micron-sized clay particles, higher +
barrier resistance will be expected for nanoclay-polymer composite +
than micron-clay-polymer complex. This also suggests that the barrier +
properties of the polymer/claynanocomposite will strongly depend on +
the degree of the dispersion of the nanoclay in thepolymer matrix, or +
obviously on the exfoliation degree of nano-clay layers. Therefore,
the +
change of the barrier properties of the composite reflects indirectly
the +
dispersion state of the nanoclay in polymer matrix, if other
conditions +
are maintained the same. +
Filler Reinforcement +

Fillers can be added to a barrier polymer to reduce the price of the +
coating, to enhance the opacity or for mechanical reinforcement. The +
addition of fillers to polymer matrices can either increase or
decrease +
the permeability, depending on the compatibility and adhesive +
properties between the polymer and the filler and also on their
relative +
concentrations. Dispersion polymers are readily compatible with +
conventional coating pigments such as clay. The barrier properties are +
improved by increasing the diffusion path length of the permeating +
species (Figure 2). +

The critical pigment volume concentration CPVC is an important +
factor concerning filler addition. The CPVC concept refers to the +
point where the binder concentration is just large enough to fill in +
the interstitial voids between pigment particles for conventional +
paper coating, the addition of fillers is usually done at
concentrations +
considerably higher than the CPVC. In barrier dispersions, on the
other +
hand, pigments are added at a concentration well below the CPVC. +
The reason is that an increased number of filler particles will lead to
an +
increase in voids, thus leading to an increase in permeability a
higher +
binder concentration gives a more flexible coating, and the optimum +
pigment volume concentration becomes a compromise between +
barrier properties and flexibility. The CPVC of dispersions is
affected +
by the immobilization volumes (i.e. the packing volume of the wet +
coating, which is dependent on particle shape, size, size distribution
of +
pigment and binders, colloidal, chemical and rheological properties), +
the consolidation power of the binders, the type of substrate and +
the drying conditions. The most important factors concerning filler +
addition to barrier dispersions are the adhesion of the binder to the +
pigment particles, the particle shape and the chemical nature of the +
pigments. The CPVC value of a polymer/pigment system depends on +

the latex particle size and its size distribution [34]. Increased
particle size +
decreases the CPVC as does an increased value of the glass transition +
temperature. In contrast, in dispersions where strong deformation of +
the latex particles occurs, a higher CPVC is obtained due to the more +
dense packing of polymer (Figure 3). +
Nanoparticulate Materials +

Montmorillonite is a naturally abundant clay material with a +
layered aluminosilicate structure that is often used in nanocomposite +
technology due to its high surface area and large aspect ratio.
Dispersion +
of layered silicates in a polymer matrix can result in a number of +
different states, leading to micro composites, intercalated or
exfoliated +
nanocomposites. It is believed that complete and homogeneous +
dispersion in which the clay platelets are arranged in a non-parallel +
manner (exfoliation) will give the highest performance improvements +
in coatings. The aluminosilicates can be dispersed into individual
layers +
only 10 Å thick. The distance between the platelets, the basal
spacing, +
is defined as the distance from a certain plane in one layer to the +
corresponding plane in a parallel layer. Montmorillonite is
hydrophilic +
but can be made organophilic by exchanging the naturally occurring +
Na+ ions in the galleries of the clay with organic cations, e.g. alkyl +
ammonium surfactants, making them more compatible with organic +
polymers. The relationship between surface diameter and thickness +
of the nanoclay particles is defined as the aspect ratio. Typically, +
commercial nanoclays have aspect ratios between 50 and 1000, which is +
much larger than for typical clay pigments (10–30) used in paperboard +
coating. The large aspect ratio of nanoclays makes them effective for +
barrier improvement even at very low (≤5% by weight) concentrations +
[35-37]. Higher weight additions may be difficult from a processing +
perspective, because the viscosity of the dispersions +
increases +
significantly at increased loads of clay. The use of nanoparticles in +
paper and board coating is thus advantageous, particularly given that +
less material is required (thinner coating layers) to reach the
desired +
barrier or mechanical properties. Less material use leads to reduced +
costs and reduced amounts of waste [38]. Southern Clay Products and +
Nanocor are among the biggest suppliers of montmorillonite clays for +
nanocomposite applications. The addition of a nano filler is made to +
reinforce the polymer, i.e. to increase the strength and toughness of
the +
material [39]. Other issues are to enhance the optical, thermal or
barrier +
properties. The mechanism of barrier improvement relies on increasing +
the path length that the molecules have to traverse while diffusing +
through the film, i.e. forcing them to take a tortuous path, which
leads +
to significantly prolonged transmission rates The barrier properties
of +
a nanocomposite material depend on the relative orientation of the +
silicate layers and on the state of aggregation and dispersion. The
plate- +
like structure of clay increases the path for diffusing molecules,
thus +
decreasing the permeability of molecules through the material [40]. +
Porous nanoparticles into which the diffusing molecules can penetrate +

are also efficient in this respect [41]. Improvement of barrier
properties +
by up to four orders of magnitude upon incorporation of nanoclays +
in a polymer coating has been reported. The lack of a completely +
exfoliated structure has been used to explain why an efficient
reduction +
in WVTR could not be observed when montmorillonite clays were +
dispersed in a barrier latex [42]. The incorporated clay particles can +
inhibit crystallization of the polymer matrix by restricted chain +
mobility through the association with the clay plates. This has led +
to an increase in the tensile strength of starch/polyester blends with +
increased montmorillonite content. Fischer et al. reported the blend +
of a thermoplastic starch with clay particles using a modifier (e.g. +
cat ionized starch) which is compatible with both the clay and the +
matrix. The results observed were a homogeneous incorporation of +
clay particles in the starch matrix, followed by an easier processing +
and a strong decrease in hydrophobicity. The stiffness, strength and +
toughness of the film could also be changed by changing the water +
content. Homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in nematic crystal +
matrices of liquid crystalline polymers has also been observed [40]. +
Nanoclays have been demonstrated to reduce both the water vapor and +
the OP of PLA and PLA–PCL films. The use of nanosized materials in +
food packaging should be approached so as to minimize the potential +
risks with inhalation or ingestion of small particles that can have +
unhealthy effects on the human body [41]. However, overall migration +
tests and analysis of specific metals (Fe, Mg and Si) have shown no +
change in the quantity of these species in food that has been in
contact +
with a potato starch/clay nanocomposite film (Figure 4). +
Characterization and Test Methods +

The coated specimens should condition for 24 h at 23°C and 50% +
relative humidity before any measurements, this is as per ISO
standards. +
Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) SEM of the surfaces of the +

samples is obtain with a Digital Scanning Electron Microscope. +

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is employ to estimate the degree of +
orientation of the clay particles in the polymer film. The
measurements +
should perform in the cross-direction of the coating. +

Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) is use to +
assess the chemical composition of the surface of the coatings on
paper. +
Water vapor transmission rate, WVTR, is measure using +
gravimetric cups according to TAPPI method T 448 om-97. Silica gel, +
35 ± 0.1 g in each cup, as the desiccant WVTR g/ (m2 day−1) is

angle values is measure as a function of time. +

Cobb test: This is important test to determine the water resistant +

properties of paper. This test can be done by Cobb tester. +
Conclusions +

Polymer-nano clay is good choice in the development of new +
functionality of paper by coating. While there is still further
research +
needed to reach the requirements set on all types of functional +
properties as well as on material availability, process ability,
suitability +
for product contact, etc., the remaining hindrance to be overcome is, +
in most cases, the cost. Although the price for materials and
processing +
will increase with increased modification of polymers and clay. +
Reduction of the final price for each package should be achievable by +
increased volume of production. However, there exists no universal +
barrier chemical that covers all potential applications and still fulfil
is +
all possible requirements. Future functional surface treatment of
Paper +
will most likely involve multilayer coatings where each single layer +
makes its own specific, property-based contribution with its specific +
properties to the overall performance of the coated products.
