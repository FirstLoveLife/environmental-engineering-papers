Abstract
The major inorganic solid residues of chemical pulp mills include green
liquor dregs, various lime
residues, recovery boiler fly ash, and salt cake produced at the
chlorine dioxide generator. Only a
small proportion of these residues is currently utilized outside the
mill area: landfill disposal and
reuse at the mill are the most typically applied methods. The situation
should be improved in the
future for environmental and economical reasons. The focus of this
review is on the separation of
inorganic pulp mill residues to enhance the possibilities of their
utilization. Solid-liquid separation
operations, such as filtration and sedimentation, and the associated
treatment processes, are
described in close detail. The review aims at recognizing the most
promising residues for
utilization, as well as enhancing the understanding of the material
balance of chemical pulp mills.
The review also covers the most potential industrial applications for
the utilization of residues, as
well as the possibilities of using them as raw material in value-added
products.


1.

Chemical pulp mills produce a number of different waste streams, which
can be roughly divided
into organic and inorganic residues. The focus of this review article is
on the main inorganic side
streams, including green liquor dregs (GLD), various lime residues, fly
ash of the recovery boiler,
and the sodium sesquisulfate produced in the ClO2 generator. Out of
these residues, all except
sesquisulfate are more or less alkaline. The motivation for this study
has arisen from the increasing
need to utilize these residues as valuable materials and products
instead of the currently applied
landfill disposal and recirculation in the chemical recovery cycle of
the mill. The general trend in
the pulp and paper industry has been towards the minimization of
landfill disposal (Monte et al.,
2009). Some of the most important drivers towards the utilization of
inorganic residues are
probably the increasing cost of landfill disposal (Eroglu et al., 2006),
the decreasing availability
of high-grade mineral resources (Tilton, 2001), the high price of
fertilizers (Brunelle et al., 2015),
and the increasing demand of soil amendments due to intensified
agriculture (Edmondson et al.,
2014). GLD and lime mud are produced and stacked in landfill sites in
relatively large quantities,
whereas the other inorganic residues are available at much smaller
amounts.

Introduction



Appropriate separation technology is of high importance in the chemical
recovery cycle of Kraft
mills. Solid-liquid separation is performed for green liquor to get rid
of the dregs, and for the lime
slurry to remove grits from the slaker and to separate white liquor from
the solids after
recausticizing. Washing of the separated solids is typically carried out
in a sedimentation system
or a filter unit, sometimes sequentially in both. The separation
technology does not only enable

efficient operation of the mill, but may also enhance the possibilities
of utilizing the inorganic
residues. Purification may be necessary to reduce the pH and to remove
harmful components, such
as heavy metals (Nurmesniemi et al., 2005; Cabral et al., 2008; Sanchez
and Tran, 2005). Soil
contamination is one possible environmental side effect of landfilling
the inorganic wastes
generated in pulp mills which contain heavy metals. The leachability of
heavy metals from GLD
has been extensively studied by Manskinen et al. (2011) and Pöykiö et
al. (2014). The study of
Cabral et al. (2008) supports the idea of possible release of metals
into the soil from inorganic
wastes of pulp mills. Furthermore, the water resources near the landfill
area are in threat of
pollution by the liberated heavy metals. In the best case, the
purification and dewatering steps
which are sometimes required for utilization outside the mill area could
be performed in the
existing separation equipment of the mill (Tikka, 2008). For this
reason, the currently applied
separation techniques and their challenges are paid special attention to
in this review. The
separation aspects are discussed with respect to the overall chemical
balance of the mill, because
proper removal of non-process elements (NPE) from the recovery cycle is
of crucial importance.
The most potential applications of the residues found in the literature
are also discussed.



Chemical recovery in Kraft pulping


2.

2.1. Chemical recovery cycle

The recovery boiler is the heart of a Kraft pulp mill: it is essential
for the recovery of the cooking
chemicals, and it utilizes the heating value of the extracted wood
components. Good runnability
of the chemical recovery cycle of the process is the key to economical
and material-efficient
operation of a pulp mill. The efficiency of the recovery of pulping
chemicals can be as high as 97
% (Sretenovec, 2012). The sodium-sulfur balance in black liquor after
cooking is affected by the
quality of the raw material of the mill, and by several process-related
factors. The sulfur in black
liquor takes many forms, for instance sulfide, thiosulfate, sulfite,
sulfate, and organic sulfur (Hupa,
1993). Sodium is present e.g. as NaOH, Na2O, and with sulfur e.g. as
sodium sulfide Na2S,
thiosulfate Na2S2O3, sulfate Na2SO4, sodium sulfite Na2SO3, and sodium
bound in organic
material. Sodium and sulfur account for approximately 20 % and 3-6 % of
the dry solids in black
liquor, respectively (Mikkanen, 2000).

The aim of the recovery cycle is to be able to reuse the sodium- and
sulfur-containing pulping
chemicals. The cooking liquor is effective only if the chemicals are in
a reactive form as NaOH
and Na2S. Therefore, it is important to be able to obtain a high degree
of sulfur reduction in the
recovery boiler (Tran and Vakkilainen, 2008). However, after the burning
of the concentrated
black liquor in the recovery boiler, a great proportion of the cooking
chemicals in the smelt are in
an ineffective form as sodium carbonate Na2CO3 and sodium sulfate
Na2SO4. Among the smelt
compounds, only Na2S is effective without further conversion (Hupa,
2002). The sodium carbonate
content is converted back to the effective hydroxide form by
recausticizing (Tikka, 2008). A
simplified sketch showing the four major operations in the chemical
recovery cycle and the most
important process liquors is presented in Fig. 1, which also shows the
scope of this review.

2.2. Chemistry of recausticizing

The dissolution of the smelt from the recovery boiler can be regarded as
the starting point of the
recausticizing process. In order to avoid loss of chemicals, sodium in
particular, weak wash liquor
obtained from lime mud and green liquor dregs washings is fed into the
dissolver. At this stage
sodium is soluble Na2CO3 and most of the sulfur is in the reduced form
as soluble sodium sulfide
Na2S, which is an effective cooking chemical and should not therefore be
affected by the
recausticizing process (Sixta, 2006).

The main reaction in the recausticizing process is conversion of the
Na2CO3 content of the green
liquor to NaOH (Pöykiö et al., 2006a). All the important reactions
taking place at the recausticizing
plant are well-known and have been presented in a countless number of
literature sources, for
instance by Tikka (2008), Theliander (2008) and Sanchez (2008). The main
reaction, conversion
of sodium carbonate to hydroxide, requires large quantities of soluble
hydroxide, which is obtained
by the calcination of lime mud (CaCO3) in the lime kiln to produce CaO,
which is subsequently
converted according to Eq. (1) to Ca(OH)2 with green liquor in the
slaker, where the recausticizing
reaction is initialized:


















(1)


The produced calcium hydroxide is slightly soluble in the liquid. Its
solubility in water is 1.9 g L-
1 at 0 °C and 1.3 g L-1 at 50 °C (National Lime Association, 2007). It
is, however, reactive enough
with the sodium carbonate content of the green liquor to be slowly
converted to sodium hydroxide
in a series of causticizing reactors:










(2)


The recausticizing reaction is exothermic and is typically performed in
a series of 5 to 9 stirred
tank reactors, where the impeller is usually either of the pitched-blade
or the Rushton turbine type
and rotates at a speed of 60-80 rpm (Theliander, 2008). The reaction is
reversible, which means
that it is impossible to obtain a complete conversion. The equilibrium
is influenced by the
concentration of the total titratable alkali at the applied level of
sulfidity (Mehtonen, 2013).

The solid byproduct of recausticization, calcium carbonate, present in
lime mud is converted to
the reactive calcium oxide form in the lime kiln according to
















(3)


The lime kiln is typically a long (50-120 m) cylindrical rotary kiln
with a diameter of about 2-4 m
(Järvensivu et al., 2001a; Hagemoen, 1993). The specific energy
consumption of the lime kiln is
considerable, varying usually from 5.5 to 6.5 GJ per ton of CaO
(Järvensivu et al., 2001a). The
purity of the obtained CaO is over 80 %, and the main impurities are
unburnt calcium carbonate,
silica and magnesium oxide (Bharathi et al., 2013).

Inorganic pulp mill residues

In practice, various inorganic impurities consisting e.g. of inert
material and non-process elements
must be removed from the recovery cycle to enable trouble-free operation
of the mill. These
impurities originate mainly from limestone containing inert CaCO3,
oxides of iron, aluminum, and
silicon (Lewis and Crocker, 1969; Andreola et al., 2011), as well as
from insoluble compounds
removed from the green liquor. The most essential factors affecting the
recausticization system
include the quality of lime and its relative dosage, green liquor
concentration, temperature, and the
stirring conditions in the reactors (Andreola et al., 2011).


3.

3.1. Origin of the residues

The major inorganic side streams in the recovery cycle are formed (Fig.
2) due to various reasons:

 Green liquor dregs consist of insoluble residue of the smelt
dissolver, where the suspended
solids content is 600-2000 mg L-1 (Tikka, 2008). The reported pH of GLD
from the output of
a precoat filter is typically within the range of 10-12.8 (Manskinen et
al., 2011). The dregs are
of high importance regarding the disposal of the non-process elements
(Ulmgren, 1997; Ellis
and Johnson, 2011).


 Lime mud is the solid byproduct of causticizing, regenerated in the
lime kiln. Part of it is
removed from the process as a precoat in the GLD filter (Tikka, 2008).
The pH of lime mud
varies, and is often at the same level with that of GLD (He et al.,
2009; Sthiannopkao and
Sreesai, 2009).

 Slaker grits are formed as a coarse residue on the bottom of the lime
slaker, from where they
are removed with a rake or an inclined screw. The dwell time of the
suspension in the slaker
is typically about 15 to 25 minutes, and the solids contents of slaker
grits is typically about 75
% (Sanchez and Tran, 2005). The pH of slaker grits is usually higher
than 12.5 (Li M.A. et
al., 2012).

 Other lime residues are either dusts formed in the lime dryer or the
lime kiln, from where they
are collected by electrostatic precipitation, or miscellaneous solids
collected sporadically by
mechanical cleaning of the kiln. These minor residues do not have much
practical importance,
so they are not discussed in closer detail in this review.


 Fly ash formation in a recovery boiler is initialized in the gas
phase. The temperature in the
recovery boiler (max. 1300-1400 °C) is high enough to volatilize alkali
metals, such as Na
and K, as well as other elements (S, Cl, and C), which are necessary for
alkali salt formation
(Mikkanen et al., 1999). Most volatilized Na is converted in the gas
phase to NaOH, which is
subsequently converted with SO2 to Na2SO4 (Saturnino, 2012). The pH of
recovery boiler fly
ash is typically lower than that of lime residues, as reported e.g. by
Sthiannopkao and Sreesai
(2009). The fly ash from the recovery boiler is precipitated by
electrostatic precipitators (ESP).
The fly ash differs from various power boiler fly ashes so significantly
that it is often called
ESP salt instead of fly ash.



[#6]#Page 6#

 Sesqui salt is generated at mills producing ClO2 for bleaching. The
reaction incorporates
reduction of sodium chlorate by methanol in strongly acidic conditions
(Chen et al., 2004).
The solid byproduct, sodium sesquisulfate Na3H(SO4)2, is produced as a
salt cake and
separated with a filter, and the second byproduct, formic acid, results
from the oxidation of
methanol (Thompson et al., 1995; Burke et al., 1993):



(4)


It is common to use excess sulfuric acid in order to ensure a high
reaction rate, so the sesquisulfate
product contains approximately 20 w-% of sulfuric acid (Bucher et al.,
2009; Burke et al., 1993).
Sodium sesquisulfate formation takes place outside the chemical recovery
cycle, but as the salt
cake is often mixed with black liquor to recover sodium and sulfur, it
contributes to the chemical
balance of the mill.


3.2. Quantities of residues

The annual quantity of landfilled GLD solids in Finland was 64 200
metric tons in 2012 (Finnish
Forest Industries, 2013). The figure includes also the lime mud used as
a precoat. Manskinen
(2013) mentions that 90 000 metric tons of GLD were generated, according
to an earlier report of
Finnish Forest Industries from the year 2012. Assuming an annual Kraft
pulp production of 7
million tons in Finland, and the fact that GLD from semi-chemical
pulping was not included in the
-1. This is in
number, the specific production rate in chemical pulping was 12.8 kg
dregs tpulp
accordance with the typical range of 4-20 kg per ton of pulp, reported
by Nurmesniemi et al.
(2005).

Statistics about global GLD production are not available. Rough
approximation of the quantities
can be performed on the basis of available sources. Sanchez and Tran
(2005) report GLD
production of four North American mills to vary from less than 3 000 to
over 13 000 kg per day,
-1.
corresponding to 4-11 kgdregs tpulp
This specific production rate is in good agreement with that of the
Finnish mills discussed above.
If the same amount of GLD is approximated with relation to the global
production of Kraft pulp,
117 million tons per year (Sixta, 2006), the annual quantity of GLD
generated globally ranges
from 0.5 to 1.3 million tons. Most of globally generated GLD is
currently landfilled (Manskinen,
2013; Pöykiö et al., 2006a).
Table 1 lists the two major lime fractions, their production amounts,
and the currently used
methods of disposal and reuse.

Out of the lime residues, only lime mud is available in considerable
quantities. The amount of
slaker grits typically increases when the quality of the burned lime is
poor (Sanchez, 2008).

The amount of recovery boiler ESP salt generated at pulp mills is
relatively small, and statistics
are not available. The ESP salt produced in recovery boilers represents
only a very small proportion
of all ashes generated in the industry: earlier studies have reported
the share of ESP salt to be about
1 % of the total ash production (Elliot and Mahmood, 2006).

The production of one ton of ClO2 (Eq. (4)) generates 1.35 tons of
sodium sesquisulfate
Na3H(SO4)2, which is often neutralized with NaOH to obtain 1.46 tons of
Na2SO4 (Thompson et
al., 1995). Alternative processes for chlorine dioxide production, for
instance a H2O2 based process
have been developed to reduce the environmental impacts (Burke et al.,
1993; Chen et al., 2004;
Crump et al., 1998; Qian et al., 2007).


3.3. Composition of residues

The composition of the inorganic residues varies between mills and by
time. The elemental and
mineralogical compositions of the residues are discussed below.


3.3.1. Green liquor dregs

Green liquor dregs are separated from green liquor as a thick slurry or
cake: the moisture content
varies from less than 60 to about 70 w-% (Matilainen et al., 2014). The
main solid compounds in
GLD are calcium carbonate CaCO3, magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2, carbon,
and metal sulfides,
especially FeS (Sanchez and Tran, 2005; Jia et al., 2014). The liquid
phase contains alkaline
compounds, such as Na2CO3 and NaOH, which are responsible for the high
pH. From the
economical point of view it is important that these alkaline compounds
are recovered by GLD
washing (Tikka, 2008).

Martins et al. (2007) have characterized dried GLD with different
methods. The main elements in
the oven-dried solids in decreasing order were Ca, O, Mg, Na, Fe, S, Mn,
Si, Al, K, and P. The
most abundantly present mineral phase was calcite, typically present
with some associated Mg
content, i.e. Ca1-xMgxCO3. In calcined samples, the most abundant phases
were, correspondingly,
Ca1-xMgxO and MgO. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed the presence of
gipsite CaSO4∙2H2O,
which started to degrade at low temperatures, and calcite, which was
calcined at 700-1000 °C.
Rothpfeffer (2007) reports average concentrations of different metals
and phosphorus in the GLD
of a large number of samples collected from three mills, determined with
inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (Table 2).

3.3.2. Lime residues

The two major lime kiln residues exist in the slurry form as lime mud
and slaker grits. Both these
residues consist of CaCO3, CaO and various impurities. Previous research
has typically focused
only on lime mud, and to some extent on slaker grits (Tikka, 2008).

According to the mineralogical characterizations performed by Martins et
al. (2007), CaCO3
accounts for approximately 90 % of the mineral phases in lime mud.
Gypsum (< 4 w-%) in the
dihydrate form CaSO4∙2H2O is also present. However, the calcium
carbonate content in lime mud
seems to be higher than 90 % at most mills. Bharathi et al. (2013)
report CaCO3 contents of 92-95
w-%, and Tran (2008) extends the upper limit to 97 w-%, listing also
other elements, such as Mg,
Si, Al, Fe, P, Na, K, and S, which are present in various forms in small
amounts. Martins et al.
(2007) report that, unlike lime mud, slaker grits contain considerable
quantities of Ca2SiO4 (almost
30 w-%), CaNa2(CO3)2∙2H2O (about 20-30 w-%), Ca(OH)2 (12 %), and also
2-4 % of Mg(OH)2.
As above in the case of GLD, the high percentage of Si- and
Na-containing mineral phases does
not mean that Si and Na are actually present in proportionally high
quantities.

The moisture content of slaker grits is typically about 24 w-%, the Ca
and Na contents are slightly
below 400 g kg-1 and 30 g kg-1, respectively, and the concentrations of
other elements are below
10 g kg-1 each (Li M.A. et al., 2012).


3.3.3. Recovery boiler ESP salt

The composition of recovery boiler fly ash, i.e. recovery boiler ESP
salt, differs significantly from
that of other boilers. While conventional biomass boilers generate
mainly metal oxides, the
recovery boiler generates sodium sulfate Na2SO4 and sodium carbonate
Na2CO3 as the main
components, accounting for approximately 80-85 w-% and 8-15 w-%,
respectively (Monte et al.,
2009; Sretenovec, 2012). Other salts, e.g. K2SO4, NaCl, and K2CO3 may be
present at lower

[#9]#Page 9#

Current separation practices

quantities (Sthiannopkao and Sreesai, 2009; Sretenovec, 2012). The
concentration of K is typically
2-7 w-% (Mikkanen et al., 1999; Johansson, 2005).


3.3.4. Salt cake from chlorine dioxide production

The salt cake produced in the chlorine dioxide generator consists mainly
of sodium sesquisulfate
and sulfuric acid. The wet cake may also contain low concentrations of
other reaction chemicals
and products (Eq. (4)), and probably traces of intermediate products
(Burke et al., 1993).


4.

4.1. Washing and filtration of green liquor dregs

There are three main goals in green liquor treatment: the separation of
dregs from green liquor, the
treatment of dregs to an appropriate quality for disposal, and
decreasing the temperature of green
liquor for recausticizing (Tikka, 2008). Previous studies (Mattsson and
Richards, 2009; Sedin and
Theliander, 2004) have shown that the separation of dregs from green
liquor is difficult in practice.
Fig. 3 shows the conventional process sequences for the separation of
GLD.


4.1.1. Separation of dregs from green liquor

Dregs are separated from green liquor by sedimentation or filtration,
which is often followed by a
washing and dewatering stage, to minimize the impact of the disposed
dregs on the environment
and to recover valuable alkaline compounds (Empie Jr et al., 1999;
Mattsson and Richards, 2009;
Theliander, 2008). Dregs are removed as the underflow at the consistency
of 2-5 w-%, while the
green liquor overflow contains 60–100 mg L-1 of suspended solids.
Flocculants can be used in
order to obtain faster and more efficient separation (Sanchez and Tran,
2005; Taylor, 2013).
Sometimes a specially designed sludge blanket clarifier, where the
slurry is fed beneath a
flocculated sludge layer, is used to operate at a high capacity, which,
however, requires plenty of
flocculants (Ives, 1968; Tikka, 2008).

Gelatinous magnesium silicate Mg2(Si1-xAlx)O4 is known to reduce the
settling rate. A high level
of magnesium in black liquor, originating from oxygen delignification,
may cause slow settling
(Taylor, 2013; Taylor and McGuffie, 2007; Ulmgren, 1987). However, the
addition of magnesium
salt helps to precipitate aluminum with hydrotalcite (Ulmgren, 1987),
but causes formation of
adverse magnesium silicate (Taylor, 2013). Additionally, low temperature
and high concentration
of
the crystallization of pirssonite
(Na2Ca(CO3)2∙2H2O), which causes a higher loss of sodium with the dregs
(Zakir et al., 2013).

Filtration systems have become more popular in primary clarification,
because they have a better
separation efficiency and are more tolerant to process variations. Tube,
cassette and cross-flow
filters are applied commonly in the primary removal of GLD, while
(hyperbaric) precoat disc
filters and chamber filter presses excel in the separation and washing
of dregs (Sanchez and Tran,

2005; Theliander, 2008; Tikka, 2008). The filter medium is in all cases
cleaned with water, but it
can be also washed by acid, or replaced with a new one at certain
intervals (Theliander, 2008;
Tikka, 2008). Lime mud is used as the precoat material when dregs are
separated with rotary disc
filters (Tikka, 2008), due to the very poor filterability of the dregs
sludge. The average specific
cake resistance without a precoat is typically about 1013 m kg-1, and
increases with pressure
(Theliander, 2008), which indicates a compressible cake (Svarovsky,
1981). In disc filters, the
formed cake is washed if needed and dewatered by displacement of liquid
by gas, and finally
removed by a scraper mechanism (Theliander, 2008; Wakeman and Tarleton,
1999). Aluminum
sulfate or lime mud can be added into the smelt dissolving tank to
improve the separation (Taylor,
2013; Sedin and Theliander, 2004).


4.1.2. Washing and dewatering of dregs sludge

When clarification and cross-flow filtration techniques are used for the
clarification of green
liquor, the resulted dregs sludge has to be washed to recover the
soluble alkali by using secondary
clarifiers, vacuum filters or pressure filters. The approximate ratio of
water to dregs in washing
clarifiers is 12:1. The removed dregs from washing clarifiers should be
dewatered by filtration or
centrifugation before landfilling (Sanchez and Tran, 2005; Tikka, 2008).
In earlier dregs handling
systems, a clarifier followed by a rotary vacuum filter was applied
(Theliander, 2008).

According to the literature (Sanchez and Tran, 2005; Tikka, 2008), the
vacuum precoat filter uses
less water, but has a higher loss of alkali in comparison with the
washing clarifier. The lime mud
requirement is 1 to 2 times the mass of separated dregs, so the precoat
is a surplus to the amount
of cake to be landfilled. The use of filter presses to squeeze the dregs
at a high pressure helps to
minimize the quantity of cake. Decanter centrifuges can also be
effectively utilized for the
separation of dregs.


4.2.

After the causticizing reaction, the formed lime mud has to be separated
from white liquor, to
recover alkali, to separate potential impurities, and to enable
energy-efficient operation of the lime
kiln (Parthasarathy and Krishnagopalan, 1999; Tikka, 2008; Tran and
Vakkilainen, 2007).
Removal of NPE from the recovery cycle is important in order to maintain
the quality of the lime
mud, which is necessary for trouble-free operation of the lime mud
separation units and the lime
kiln (Tikka, 2008; McGuffie and Taylor, 2007). Additionally, the sulfur
(TRS) emissions of the
lime kiln can be reduced by lime mud washing (Das and Jain, 2001).
Sedimentation and filtration
are most typically applied at this stage. The dewatered lime mud can be
dried by using e.g. a flash
mud dryer before sending to the lime kiln (Järvensivu et al., 1999; Lee
et al., 2006; Tran and
Vakkilainen, 2007).


4.2.1. Separation of lime mud

The conditions in the slaking and causticizing process have an effect on
the separation of lime
mud. Factors such as temperature, lime dosage, speed of the stirrer and
residence time affect the

Separation of lime residues

10

sedimentation rate of lime (Theliander and Gren, 1987). The results of
the study of Theliander and
Gren showed that a longer residence time and an increased lime dosage
resulted in a slower settling
rate. The quality of lime has an important role as well. The
clarification process has been described
in close detail in the literature (Quesada, 2003; Theliander and Gren,
1987; Tikka, 2008). The
solids content of lime mud, i.e. the clarifier underflow, is usually
between 35 and 40 w-%. The
concentration of alkali in separated lime mud can reach 20 % of white
liquor production, so
washing in another clarifier is often performed prior to final
dewatering with a filter.

The most typically used filters, i.e. candle and disc filters, are
relatively similar to those used in
green liquor handling (Sixta, 2006; Theliander, 2008). In a candle
filter, the lime mud solids remain
on the outer surface of the filter cloth and build up a cake of
sufficient thickness. The filtration
elements are back-flushed to remove the cake and to keep the pores of
the filter medium open.
Dilution washing in a separate tank is applied for the recovery of
remaining alkali from the cake,
and the suspension is filtered again with either a candle filter or a
belt-type filter (Tikka, 2008;
Wakeman and Tarleton, 1999). As in the case of clarifiers, the suspended
solids content of washed
lime mud slurry is 30-35 w-%, and has to be reduced prior to calcining
(Tikka, 2008). Pressurized
disc filters are more complex, with higher power consumption than
clarifiers, but their separation
efficiency and water requirement are better (Tikka, 2008; Theliander,
2008; Sixta, 2006). As a
summary, the solid content of lime mud varies from 35 to 70 w-%,
depending on the equipment
used.

According to Tikka (2008), a final solid content of up to 80-90 w-% is
expected for dewatered
lime mud, and the concentration of water-soluble alkali as NaOH, on a
dry basis, should be under
0.15 w-%. The approximate solid load is 5–7 t m-2 d-1 when a lime mud
precoat layer of 10-15 mm
is applied (Sixta, 2006; Theliander, 2008; Tikka, 2008). The average
specific cake resistance is
relatively low, typically < 1010 m kg-1, and the cake is slightly
compressible (Ek et al., 2009).
Based on the wash curve presented by Eriksson et al. (1996), the wash
ratio has to be quite high,
probably higher than 2, to obtain the target level of NaOH content. The
filtrate of the lime mud
washing step is called weak white wash (liquor) and is reused in the
smelt dissolver, while only
the surface layer of the cake is scraped off. After dewatering, lime mud
can be dried further by
flue gas in a lime mud drier and sent to the lime kiln (Järvensivu et
al., 2001a).

Problems in lime mud filtration can occur due to a high silica content
and formation of
aluminosilicate (Tran and Vakkilainen, 2007; McGuffie and Taylor, 2007;
Taylor and Bossons,
2006). It has also been observed that the level of the TRS emissions of
the lime kiln correlates with
the residual alkali, and can be reduced by efficient lime mud filtration
(Järvensivu et al., 1999;
Järvensivu et al., 2001a,b).


4.2.2. Separation of slaker grits

In the slaker, the heavy and relatively coarse insoluble grits settle on
the bottom and are removed
e.g. with an inclined screw conveyer, which may be equipped with a
washing mechanism (Sixta,
2006; Tikka, 2008). The slaked lime is collected as the overflow and
pumped to the causticizer
train. The pH of washed grits may increase by time, due to slow slaking
of residual lime (Sanchez

[#12]#Page 12#



11

Electrostatic precipitation and treatment of recovery boiler salt

and Tran, 2005). Slaker grits can also be ground with a ball mill or a
hammer mill and reused in
the lime slaker or on the GLD filter as a precoat (Sanchez and Tran,
2005).


4.3.

4.3.1. Electrostatic precipitation

The ESP is a conventional particulate control system, where an
electrical field is applied to collect
electrically charged particles. The typical concentration range of
collected fine (0.2-1 µm) dust is
5-15 g m-3 of flue gas (Hupa, 1993), and the separation efficiency is
often over 99 % (Lind et al.,
2006). Electrostatically separated fly ash is typically mixed with black
liquor and re-burned in a
recovery boiler. Typically about 10 % of the sodium in black liquor
remains in this fly ash
circulation, and only a small proportion of sodium and sulfur leaves the
process (Hupa, 1993).


4.3.2. Treatment processes

The ESP ash can be treated either periodically or continuously in order
to lower the levels of NPE
in the recovery cycle to prevent operational problems, such as plugging
of the recovery boiler due
to the reduced melting point of the solid deposits (Hart et al., 2010;
Brown et al., 1998; Jaretun
and Aly, 2000) and accelerated corrosion of the recovery boiler (Rapp
and Pfromm, 1998a; Jaretun
and Aly, 2000; Minday et al., 1997). The most potential ESP ash
treatment techniques are
introduced below.


Ion exchange has become an attractive technique for ESP ash treatment.
The commercial Recoflo
system, described e.g. by Brown et al. (1999), is often used. This
technology utilizes amphoteric
fine resins, short columns, high flow rates, and very short cycle times
for the selective separation
of chloride. The ash is dissolved in water to form a concentrated
solution. The mixture is filtered
in a pressure pulse filter to separate the insoluble solids, and the
filtrate is treated in a salt separation
unit, where NaCl is adsorbed by the resins. The purified solution of
Na2SO4/Na2CO3 is pumped
back to the recovery cycle. Ion exchange is efficient at chloride
removal, has relatively low costs
and a small footprint. However, the process is not efficient in
potassium removal and may suffer
from bed plugging in the mill environment (Johansson, 2005).

 Leaching
The target of ESP ash leaching is to dissolve chloride and potassium and
prevent the dissolution
of sodium. In an industrial case, reductions of over 50 % in the
recovery cycle have been reported
for Cl and K (Hart et al., 2010), and the loss of soda inevitably
increases with the reduction of NPE
(Saturnino, 2012). The weight ratio of ESP ash to warm water is varied
from 1.2 to 1.6. After
leaching, the resulted slurry is centrifuged to separate solids enriched
by Na2SO4. The moisture
content of the centrifuged ash is less than 10 w-%. In comparison to the
ion exchange process,
leaching is more simple and less expensive (GonCalves et al., 2008; Hart
et al., 2010; Johansson,
2005). The addition of spent sulfuric acid can be used for the
conversion of Na2CO3 to Na2SO4,
but it causes corrosion and plugging of pipelines in the installation
(Jaretun and Aly, 2000). The

Ion exchange

[#13]#Page 13#



12

ash leaching process has been commercialized by a few equipment
manufacturers, e.g. Metso and
Andritz.

 Crystallization
In the evaporation/crystallization process, the ESP ash is dissolved in
excess of water or
condensate, using a low ash/water ratio. Crystals of Na2SO4 are formed
by subsequent vacuum
evaporation, followed by separation in a filter or centrifuge, to
produce solids with a moisture
content of 15-25 w-%. The method is relatively expensive and complicated
(Johansson, 2005;
Minday et al., 1997). The second alternative, freeze crystallization, is
a fairly efficient technique,
but also expensive (Johansson, 2005).

 Electrodialysis
The electrodialysis process may be a combination of a pre-concentration
step, electrodialysis, and
crystallization via vacuum evaporation (Rapp and Pfromm, 1998a). The ash
is first dissolved in
water or a condensate before feeding to the electrodialysis unit, which
consists of dilute and
concentrate cells, separated by anion- and cation-exchange membranes
(Pfromm, 1997a,b). The
separation takes place in the electric field as described by Rapp and
Pfromm (1998b).
Electrodialysis is a relatively uneconomical technique, in particular
when pretreatment is required
to prevent fouling (Rapp and Pfromm, 1998a; Boudihel and Benslimane,
1997).


4.4.

Sodium sesquisulfate cake is typically separated in the chloride dioxide
generator by filtration.
The existing scientific literature does not provide details about
solid-liquid separation at this stage.


5.

Landfill disposal is the prevailing method for the disposal of dregs,
lime mud and slaker grits. The
most potential alternatives for landfill disposal, as well as the
treatments required to enable the
utilization, are discussed in this section and summarized in Fig. 4.


5.1.

The reuse of inorganic residues at a pulp mill has been a good option
for decades. The high degree
of loop closure has made reuse at the mill more challenging.


5.1.1. Criticality of non-process elements

Loop closure results in the concentration of non-process elements (NPE)
in the recovery cycle
(Patrick et al., 1994). Elements forming insoluble compounds with either
green liquor or white
liquor (Table 3) are removed from the cycle with various inorganic
residues, such as GLD, lime
mud and slaker grits, while elements with high solubility in the process
liquors are removed with

recovery boiler fly ash, and to some extent with lime kiln ESP dust.
According to the literature
(Ulmgren, 1997; Manskinen et al., 2011; Lundqvist, 2009; Taylor, 2007;
Taylor and McGuffie,
2007; Taylor and Bossons, 2006; Park and Englesos, 1998; Ellis and
Johnson, 2011), the problems
caused by NPE include scaling (Al, Si, Ca, Ba), corrosion (K, Cl, Mg),
plugging of the recovery
boiler (K, Cl), increase of lime kiln dead load (Mg, P, Al, Si), poor
lime and lime mud quality,
plugging of filters (Si, Al, Ca), effects on bleaching (e.g. Mn, Fe,
Cu), and environmental impacts
due to nutrients and hazardous trace elements.

5.1.2. Green liquor dregs: waste treatment applications

Pöykiö et al. (2006a) used GLD for the liming of the acidic wastewater
of a chemical pulp mill. In
comparison with the liming capacity of a commercial lime product, the
results were excellent: 0.96
tons of GLD corresponded to one ton of the commercial ground limestone
typically used for the
neutralizing purpose. According to Pöykiö et al. (2006a), Stora Enso
Veitsiluoto mill in Kemi,
Finland, started to test the use of GLD for wastewater neutralization in
1990, and proceeded to
continuous use in 2004, when about half of GLD was utilized. The
utilization of GLD has enabled
cost savings, but has increased the (heavy)metal concentrations in the
mill effluents and in the
biosludge. Therefore, the system is not economically applicable at
inland mills located by fresh
water. The neutralization of wastewater by GLD may also cause
operational problems by increased
recirculation of NPE as a result of burning the wastewater sludge in the
recovery boiler.

Zambrano et al. (2010) performed composting experiments with Kraft mill
secondary sludge, by
using GLD as a pH-stabilizing additive. Their results show that the
sufficient dosage of dregs is 5-
8 w-%, and that this amount does not hinder the microbial degradation of
organic matter.

UPM Kymmene Oyj, Finland, has patented (pat. numbers FI 117125 and SE
528884) a process
for sulfur removal from flue gases by contacting the flue gas with the
green liquor sludge.
However, the process is not apparently used in production scale
currently.

5.1.3. Lime residues: various applications

The most typical on-site application of lime mud and slaker grits is the
use as precoat material in
the GLD filter. The details of this option were discussed above in
Section 4. Lime and limestone
are, however, multipurpose materials with many potential applications at
the mill.

A recent review article written by Zhang et al. (2014a) summarizes the
current methods of lime
mud utilization. The three most interesting applications mentioned by
Zhang et al. (2014a)
regarding on-site applications of lime mud are 1) neutralization of
acidic wastewaters, 2)
production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), described by Huege
(1998), and 3)
desulfurization of flue gas, discussed in closer detail by Li Y. et al.
(2012). Leaching of hazardous
trace elements from lime residues should be taken into account when
planning the method of
utilization.

Li M.A. et al. (2012) investigated the use of lime mud for neutralizing
the acidic wastewater of the
main sewer sump of the AP Maryvale pulp mill in Australia. The
dissolution of grits was slow: the
pH was increased only by 0.2 units during the normal residence time of
40 minutes, and it was
therefore concluded that the use of grits is not reasonable in practice,
because a significant lime
addition was still necessary to obtain the target level of pH 6.

The production of PCC, which can be used as a coating pigment in an
integrated paper mill, is
possible by using lime kiln dust as the raw material. The CaO in lime
kiln dust is first hydrated to
form Ca(OH)2, which is subsequently precipitated as CaCO3 by using
carbon dioxide (Huege,
1998). Quite similarly, all lime residues containing CaO can be regarded
as potential carbon
capture chemicals which can be used to remove CO2 from the flue gases of
the recovery boiler and
lime kiln by simple carbonation (Bobicki et al., 2012; Sun et al.,
2013). However, it should be
considered carefully whether it makes sense to use great quantities of
energy to calcine CaCO3 to
CaO in the lime kiln, and to carbonate the costly lime back to the less
valuable CaCO3.

Li Y. et al. (2012) compared calcined lime mud with commercial calcined
limestone in flue gas
desulfurization. The results obtained with lime mud were better than
those obtained with
commercial limestone in the same conditions, which can for the most part
be explained by the
higher specific surface area and near-optimal pore size of the calcined
lime mud. Additionally, the
good desulfurization capacity of lime mud may also be explained by its
impurities, such as Na2CO3
(Laursen et al., 2003).

When the pulp mill operates as a biorefinery, lime mud can be used as an
adsorbent to remove
impurities from various liquids, such as biomass hydrolysates. Shen et
al. (2011) investigated a
process where lime mud was mixed with wood chip prehydrolysate,
separated by filtration, and
calcined then in the lime kiln as usual.


5.1.4. Recovery boiler ESP salt: source of Na and S

The primary value of recovery boiler ESP salt lies in its high sodium
sulfate content, which makes
it a good source of Na and S. The washed ESP salt is returned to the
process by mixing it with

[#16]#Page 16#



15

black liquor. Recovery efficiencies of 63 and 68 % were obtained for Na
and S, respectively, when
90 % of Cl and 82 % of K were removed by the leaching of ESP salt at the
Aracruz mill in Brazil
(GonCalves et al., 2008). Hart et al. (2010) report that over 50 %
removal of Cl and K, and a soda
recovery of over 80 % has been obtained at MWV’s Evadale mill in TX,
USA.


5.1.5. Sodium sesquisulfate: source of Na, S, NaOH and H2SO4

The salt cake obtained from the ClO2 generator is often mixed with black
liquor to recover sodium
and sulfur, but the current trend seems to be towards disposal after
neutralizing with NaOH
(Bucher et al., 2009; Burke et al., 1993). Alternatives to disposal have
been developed, for instance
production of Na2SO4 and H2SO4 by metathesis (Thompson et al., 1995),
and production of NaOH
and H2SO4 by bipolar membrane electrodialysis, as discussed in detail by
Paleologou et al. (1997).
Another potential option of H2SO4 separation is the short-bed ion
exchange process introduced by
Bucher et al. (2009), which enables the Na2SO4 to be utilized in the
pulping process and the sulfuric
acid to be reused e.g. for pH adjustment at the bleaching plant.


5.2. Utilization as bulk chemicals in other industrial applications

The high buffering capacity of green liquor dregs makes them suitable
for using as an alkaline
barrier in the sealing of mine wastes generating acidic waters (Jia et
al., 2013, 2014; Mäkitalo et
al., 2014; Ragnvaldsson et al., 2014). The oxidation of sulfidic mine
waste generates acid rock
drainage (ARD), which causes serious hazards for the environment by the
mobilization of great
amounts of metals and semi-metals. A cover of soil is typically used on
mining wastes in order to
prevent oxidation and the resulting ARD formation. Mäkitalo (2012)
reports that GLD has good
potential as a cover for mining residues, due to its high water
retention capacity and low hydraulic
conductivity, which helps to prevent the water percolation and oxygen
transport to the depth of the
mine waste. In addition to GLD, other alkaline wastes like fly ash and
lime mud from pulp mills
have the potential to be utilized for this purpose (Mäkitalo et al.,
2014). In fact, inhibition of ARD
by the use of alkaline residues could solve two waste disposal problems
at the same time (Mäkitalo,
2012).

Lime mud and recovery boiler ash can be used for removing heavy metals
from the acidic
wastewaters of the metal industry by sorption and precipitation
(Sthiannopkao and Sreesai, 2009;
Wirojanagud et al., 2004). The good efficiency of calcite for this
purpose is well documented in
the literature (Garcıa-Sánchez and Alvarez-Ayuso, 2002). In the case of
recovery boiler ash, which
contains significant amounts of highly soluble salts, heavy metals are
most likely removed
primarily by precipitation, and the removal efficiency is lower than
that of lime mud (Sthiannopkao
and Sreesai, 2009).

Lime has been successfully used for microbial and physical stabilization
of domestic sewage
sludge (Valderrama et al., 2013). Among pulp mill residues, only lime
kiln dust and possibly also
the mechanically removed lime kiln residue provide CaO with some
reactivity, which reduces the
possibilities to stabilize sludges with pulp mill residues in a large
scale.


[#17]#Page 17#



16

Production of value-added products and materials

The only potential heavy industrial application of the major pulp mill
residues, not dealing with
the treatment of other industrial wastes, seems to be the improvement of
anaerobic bioprocesses
by lime mud addition, to provide nutrients and pH buffering capacity.
The topic has been
investigated by Zhang et al. (2014b), who conclude that the lime mud
addition of 10 g L-1 is optimal
for increasing biogas production from wood waste. Zhang et al. (2013)
report that hydrogen
production by bacteria is also facilitated by lime mud, the optimum
dosage being 15 g kg-1.


5.3.

5.3.1. Fertilizers and soil amendments

Harvesting trees results in a loss of nutrients from the forest
ecosystem. These lost nutrients, in
particular base cations, can be found in alkaline inorganic solid
residues of Kraft mills. Returning
these residues to the ecosystem is beneficial both ecologically and
economically, regarding the
decreased need for landfilling (Mahmoudkhani et al., 2004). Due to the
increases in disposal fees,
tougher legislation and limitations of landfill lifespan, the use of
pulp mill residues to maintain the
fertility of agricultural soils has been evaluated regarding the
utilization of lime mud, green liquor
dregs, slaker grits, and lime kiln waste (Mahmoudkhani et al., 2004; He
et al., 2009; Cabral et al.,
2008; Gagnon and Ziadi, 2012; Pöykiö et al., 2006b). Alkaline industrial
residues may prevent the
acidification of soils and can be an alternative for chemical
fertilizers in the future (Mäkelä et al.,
2012). The recirculation of inorganic pulp mill residues to the forest
requires knowledge of their
leaching properties. The Na and K salts in pulp mill residues are easily
soluble, while Ca and Mg
salts have limited solubility (Mahmoudkhani et al., 2004). GLD and lime
mud also contain heavy
metal constituents such as Cd, Cu and Zn, which are hazardous to the
environment (Österås et al.,
2005). In Finland, an environmental permit is required for the use of
the residues from Kraft mills
as forest fertilizers. The Finnish limits, which came into force in
March 2007, determine the
maximum allowed concentrations of hazardous trace elements, such as As,
Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn
and Hg in forest fertilizers (Dahl et al., 2009; Manskinen et al.,
2011). The concentrations of
hazardous trace elements in GLD and slaker grits, reported by Manskinen
et al. (2011) and
Nurmesniemi et al. (2010), respectively, were lower than the Finnish
statutory limit values for
forest fertilizers.

Inorganic residues containing calcite can be utilized for the production
of synthetic gypsum
(mainly dihydrate). In addition to other extensive industrial use of
gypsum, it is utilized as a
fertilizer (Strydom et al., 1995). Gypsum could possibly be precipitated
for fertilizing applications
by reacting sulfuric acid obtained (or separated) from the sesqui salt
with calcite, such as lime
mud, as demonstrated with pure calcite and H2SO4 by Bard and Bilal
(2011).


5.3.2. Construction materials, ceramics and catalysts

According to the amended frame introduced by the European Council Waste
Framework Directive
in 2010, resource usage should be reduced by the waste policy. Besides
this frame, the Finnish
environmental legislation sets limitations for the hazardous components
of waste materials used
for earth construction. The low concentration of hazardous trace
elements in slaker grits makes

[#18]#Page 18#



17

them potentially suitable as earth construction materials instead of
landfilling (Watkins et al.,
2010). As an example, slaker grits can partially replace Portland cement
in soil-cement bricks
(Siqueira and Holanda, 2013). It has been shown that GLD and slaker
grits can be used instead of
conventional aggregates in bituminous mixtures: slaker grits can be used
directly, while GLD
requires a washing process to remove its soluble salts (Modolo et al.,
2010). Besides grits and
GLD, lime mud residues can also be potentially utilized in construction
materials. The chemical
compatibility of lime mud with the traditionally used materials enables
it to be utilized as
secondary raw material in the production of clinker/cement (Buruberri et
al., 2015). Furthermore,
lime mud is an appropriate alternative material for the stabilization of
forest roads (Habip et al.,
2006). As a mixture with biomass fly ash, lime mud can also be used in
the fabrication of ceramics
(Qin et al., 2015). The main drawback of utilizing these residues for
the production of construction
materials is that variations in the composition of the residues may
cause serious variation in the
quality of the products.

Lime mud waste can also be applied as a heterogeneous catalyst in the
transesterification reaction
in biodiesel production (Li et al., 2014b). However, the raw lime mud
has to be activated by a
series of processes, such as drying, grinding, sieving, and calcination
(Li et al., 2014a). In another
method, lime mud is doped with potassium fluoride to prepare the
heterogeneous catalyst. In this
method, lime mud is first ground and activated at a high temperature. A
certain proportion of
activated lime mud is then mixed with the aqueous solution of potassium
fluoride. This process is
followed by drying and calcination of the resulted mixture (Li et al.,
2014b). The economy of both
processes is, however, questionable, so reuse at the pulp mill is most
likely more feasible.


6.

The utilization potential of inorganic pulp mill residues as industrial
chemicals and as raw
materials for the manufacture of various products has been recognized.
However, challenges still
remain related to feasible industrial utilization. The globally
generated amount of these wastes is
most likely over one million metric tonnes per year. Green liquor dregs
with the lime mud precoat
provide the best possibilities for industrial utilization, due to their
good availability. However,
there are two important aspects which have to be taken into account when
the possibilities for
utilization are evaluated:


Discussion

1) The overall chemical balance of the mill, including the removal of
non-process elements

from the process, should not be negatively affected, and

2) The variation in the chemical composition of the residues may cause
occasional challenges
regarding the allowable composition, such as concentration of hazardous
trace elements
and residual alkalinity.


The removal of unwanted components from the materials before utilization
increases the costs, but
should be investigated in closer detail in the future from both
technological and economical points
of view in order to increase the feasibility of utilization. The removal
of hazardous trace elements,
in particular cadmium, is crucial for enabling utilization for
fertilizing purposes. It is clear that the
existing process equipment at the mills should be utilized to enable
economical treatment, taking
into consideration the overall water balance of the mill as well. The
equipment applied for the

Conclusions

separation and treatment of green liquor dregs, lime mud and recovery
boiler fly ash are
summarized in Table S1 (Supplemental material).

It is apparent that the reuse of these waste materials will sooner or
later be a more sustainable
option than extensive landfill disposal. When it comes to large-scale
applications, it seems that
soil improvement and further refining of the residues to various
fertilizers may be the most
interesting options. The nutrient-rich composition of green liquor dregs
with lime mud precoat is
favorable for fertilizing applications. The carbonate content of this
combined residue is also high,
which is a benefit regarding slow enough liberation of the nutrients
into the soil.

The basicity of treated inorganic pulp mill residues is a positive
feature when the product is used
in areas where the natural pH of the soil is relatively low, as it is
typically in Finland. Local use of
residues as construction materials could also have some potential in the
large scale. The current
situation, however, is that there are hardly any applications where the
residues are used outside the
mill area.


7.

The separation, treatment and utilization of inorganic residues of
chemical pulp mills have been
discussed in this review. The main challenges in the utilization of the
residues are related to the
economical viability of the required treatment processes, as well as to
maintaining the overall
material balance of the mill. A few inorganic residues of chemical pulp
mills have been identified
as potential for value-added utilization. Only green liquor dregs and
lime mud are available in
significant quantities, which does not mean that the minor residues
should be totally omitted when
utilization opportunities are considered. The use of suitable separation
techniques facilitates the
purification of all these residues and helps increase the recovery of
process chemicals. Hazardous
trace elements and residual alkali are regarded as the main reasons why
the abundantly available
mixtures of green liquor dregs and lime mud precoat have not been widely
utilized in the past. In
spite of the current challenges of residue handling, previous academic
studies have concluded that
several applications for the residues can be found. Most of those
applications are related to novel
environmentally friendly technology, such as prevention of various
discharges, improvement of
bioprocesses, and replacement of traditional fertilizers and soil
improvement chemicals in the
agriculture. The inorganic pulp mill residues may be used as sustainable
bulk chemicals outside
the mill, provided that the transportation distance is relatively short.
The production of value-added
products, which requires the use of appropriate mechanical and chemical
treatment techniques,
seems to be more challenging to realize in the near future. It is
apparent that the most promising
large-scale applications for utilization, i.e. fertilizing and soil
improvement, should be investigated
more rigorously in the future. The related legislation should also be
developed to maximize the
obtainable environmental benefits.
