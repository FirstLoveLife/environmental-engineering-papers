Using Agricultural Waste for Biogas Production

as a Sustainable Energy Supply for Developing Countries



The paper focuses on the research, development, and application of
simple, reliable, efficient, and
low-maintenance technology for the production of biogas from local
organic agricultural wastes in the Republic
of Togo. This technology is intended as a sustainable decentralised
energy supply, which should meet
the economic and social conditions of developing countries in the West
African region. The paper briefly outlines
the current state of small-scale biogas production in Africa. Several
reviews of the already existing and operated
facilities in the mentioned area are named and evaluated. Specific
opportunities, limitations, and experience are
discussed and the results of the biogas production studies using
pineapple waste, carried out at Augsburg
University of Applied Sciences and at Brno University of Technology, are
presented.

1. Introduction

Togo’s recent economic performance has been relatively robust with the
gross domestic product growth being,
on average, 5.5 % in the last five years. Such economic development
requires a stable energy supply; however,
the country’s electrification ratio remains low and the electricity
supply is unreliable. In 2014, about 46 % of the
population of Togo (in the rural areas only 16 %) had access to
electricity, which was primarily supplied through
thermal power plants, imports from Nigeria and Ghana, and some
hydropower plants. Although the share of
renewable sources in the total energy consumption is relatively high,
72.8 %, this includes over 50 % of
traditional solid biomass that is not sustainably used (The World Bank,
2018). Still, the potential of Togo (or
other West African countries) in terms of decentralised renewable energy
resources is significant. The present
research therefore focuses on the development of simple and efficient
biogas production technology from
pineapple solid wastes, which would represent a sustainable alternative
to the conventional energy sources
used in Togo such as imported heavy fuel oil or natural gas. The
objective is to find the conditions leading to
the maximum biogas production and to develop a reliable technology
featuring low investment and operating
costs, which would be usable in developing countries.
About 100 plants with different digester sizes between 10 m3 and 30 m3
were installed in 2011 in Ghana
according to Arthur et al. (2011). In these plants, the input material
consists of liquid and solid residues of animal
farming, human excreta, agricultural residues, and kitchen waste. Arthur
et al. also state that, in general, only
three main digester types are employed – fixed dome digester, floating
drum digester, and Puxin digester – and
that the biogas is used mainly for cooking purposes where no gas
purification is necessary. The reason for this
is that production of electricity, where gas purity is essential
(Sakhmetova et al., 2017), biogas upgrading (Miltner
et al., 2016), biogas synthesis networks (Čuček et al., 2017), or other,
more advanced technologies are often
hard to implement in the discussed conditions. As for the bio-slurry on
the output side, typically it is used as a
fertiliser. What is more, half of the 100 plants mentioned by Arthur et
al. have been visited by these authors and
they point out that only half of those (i.e., 25) are running entirely
without technical issues. The problems and causes of the failures of African biogas production facilities are
described in detail by Amigun et al. (2008) and
are as follows:

• Poor design and construction of digesters, incorrect operation, lack
of maintenance.
• Poor dissemination strategy and the lack of project monitoring and
follow-up by the promoters.
• Poor ownership responsibility by users.
• Failure by government to support biogas technology through a focused
energy policy.

A detailed study regarding drivers and barriers for the dissemination of
biogas digesters in Ethiopia was given
by Kamp and Bermúdez Forn (2016). In their paper they state that only
around 40 % of the 1,000 biogas
production plants with digester sizes ranging from 2.5 m3 to 200 m3
installed in the last two decades are still
being operated. In Uganda, socio-economic, demographic, and political
topics related to the adoption of biogas
production as a sustainable fuel source for cooking purposes and
lighting were surveyed by Walekhwa et al.
(2009). This study mentions that family-size digesters, which use mainly
cow dung and other organic wastes
from agriculture, show high potential but are not as wide-spread as they
could be. Such digesters seem to have
a more intense application in rural areas of India, Nepal, and China,
where the different digester types are
named after their local origin or inventors. Literature is available
regarding application and optimization of their
operation – e.g. Kalia (1988) compared the biogas yield of an advanced
biogas plant type and the conventional
fixed-dome type without any moving parts that is also known as Janata
model. Construction details for the whole
system, which comprised a material investment of about 500 US$ in 1988,
were given. With an average
temperature of less than 20 °C at the location where the discussed study
was carried out, the performance in a
West African climate would be very interesting.
Example of a well-running, small-scale biogas production plant in a
rural community in India was described by
Reddy (2004). The whole community contribute with cow dung and as a
reward people get biogas for cooking
and lighting at an affordable price, and drinking water, which is
provided by an electrical pump. Electricity is
generated by a diesel engine with the generator being fuelled by a
mixture of diesel and the produced biogas.
Rajendran et al. (2012) presented an overall view of the employed
digester types in different regions in the
world. Advantages, disadvantages, construction details, and cost
estimates were given for each of these types.
Possibilities of using the biogas were described and, again, it was
emphasized that careful operation of the
digester was crucial for successful biogas production. Similarly, Hoo et
al. (2017) reviewed successful biogas
implementations in Bangladesh, China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan,
and some European countries where
effective government support policies were in place. As for Malaysia in
particular, being the second largest
producer of palm oil in the world, Kwee et al. (2017) discussed biogas
generation from palm oil mill effluent in
the rural areas where it could be effectively used as an alternative
source of energy.
In terms of biogas production solely from fruit and vegetable wastes,
for example Tahir et al. (2015) showed
that a mixed fruit waste provides a 10 % larger biogas yield than a
mixed fruit-vegetable waste. The same paper
also discussed a scalable method to increase the methane content in the
produced biogas to over 70 % using
Ca(OH)2 as a way fulfil the Pakistan's energy demands with sustainable
management of organic fraction of
municipal solid waste.
From all these studies as well as many others available it is clear that
the commonly employed techniques are
good enough to reach acceptable biogas yields; however, in terms of
reliability and maintenance there still
is much room for improvement. This is why it is important to develop a
low-maintenance technology which would
be simple yet reliable and efficient.

2. Biogas production from pineapple wastes

Seasonal processing of pineapples in Togo takes place primarily in
decentralised small- and medium-sized
enterprises such as the one shown in Figure 1. In 2016 the pineapple
production in Togo was 1,908 t
(FAOSTAT, 2018). A typical enterprise processes 1–2 t/d of fresh
pineapples. The manufactured pineapple
products are dried fruits and fruit juice and are mainly exported.
The resulting pineapple waste is about 40 % related to the fresh weight,
i.e., typically 400–800 kg/d can be used
for biogas production. The biodegradable organic waste comprises peels,
cores, stems, crown waste products,
and discarded fruits with high moisture content. Since pineapple waste
is rich in lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose,
and other carbohydrates, it is appropriate to utilise anaerobic
digestion. However, these compounds form stable
incrustations, essentially complicating the biological decomposition of
organic substances by hydrolysis, and
therefore a pre-treatment of the waste by crushing before it is fed into
the digester is recommended.
Although the produced biogas is primarily intended for utilisation as a
decentralised source of renewable energy,
it can also be used as a fuel for the process of drying of the fruits.
Moreover, biogas generation from the
mentioned wastes contributes to improved waste management and,
consequently, also to lesser environmental
pollution in developing countries. Given the typical African climate,
the liquid digestate is used directly, but in terms of developing countries with less dry climates its thickening via
various evaporation methods (Vondra et
al., 2016) could be beneficial.
The main goal is to make the microbiological conversion of pineapple
wastes into energy-rich biogas via
hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis as effective,
stable, and safe as possible. The
parameters, which influence this process, were discussed e.g. by
Baranowski (2017). In order to explore how
exactly they affect the performance of biogas production,
laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in the
first phase of the present research.

3. Materials and methods

All experiments were conducted at a laboratory-scale at temperatures
corresponding to the mean ambient
temperature in Togo. The influences of different process parameters on
quantity and composition of biogas in a
semi-batch reactor were investigated.
In total, three test series – A, B, and C – with different substrate
compositions have been successfully carried
out at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences. Hydraulic retention
times of 92 d, 73 d, and 67 d were used for
the following analyses. The samples of the substrates evaluated in the
laboratories had relatively low dry matter
content (less than 8 wt.%) and therefore no pumps were required.
Fermentation was carried out in digesters
with effective volumes of 1–3 L with inlets for feeding and outlets for
biogas and effluent. Because efficient
microbiological decomposition of organic substances requires enlargement
of the specific surface of the
substrate, the pineapple waste was machine-minced into 1–3 mm
particles.
Cow dung was used as inoculation material and co-substrate at the ratios
from 1:2.4 to 1:4 based on weight.
The compositions of the substrates are listed in Tables 1–3. Dry matter
fraction and moisture content of the
substrates were determined via drying in an oven at 105 °C until a
constant weight was obtained. For the
determination of organic dry matter (ODM) fraction, the dried solid
samples were combusted at 220 °C for 30 min
and thereafter at 550 °C for 2 h. Fermentation took place at the
temperature of (31.0–32.4)  2.0 °C and pH
values between 6 and 8. The pH value was regulated through the addition
of sodium hydrogen carbonate to
ensure stability of the digestion process. Twice a day the substrate was
carefully homogenized by manual
stirring. Fermentation liquid was checked for pH value using a pH meter
even though for plant control purposes
the ratio of volatile organic acids to total inorganic carbon (VOA/TIC)
is more suitable. The VOA/TIC value was
determined by endpoint titration using dilute sulfuric acid. During
experiments, gas samples were taken from
the sampling ports for analysis at regular intervals. The actual gas
compositions were identified using gas
chromatography mass spectrometry. Temperature, pH value, and biogas and
methane productions during
fermentation were determined.

4. Results and discussion

It was found that pineapple waste can be used successfully for biogas
generation under anaerobic conditions.
The produced raw biogas contained 41.0–70.5 vol.% of methane, 7.0–55.9
vol.% of carbon dioxide, as well as
water vapor, oxygen, nitrogen, and other components. The performance
evaluation of anaerobic digestion
in terms of all the performed test series A, B, and C can be made on the
basis of methane yield related to the
organic dry matter content as shown in Figure 2. In test series A, which
used the digesting substrate according
to Table 1, the highest methane yield of around 113.8 L/kg ODM after 92
d was achieved due to the larger
digester volume, while methane yields in test series B and C taking 73 d
and 67 d remained significantly lower.
Furthermore, the rates of methane formation vary greatly. In the test
series A, the pineapple wastes were mixed
with fresh cow dung as inoculation material and fed into the digester.
In contrast, in the other two cases, B and
C, cow dung had been stored for a few days before being mixed with
pineapple wastes so that the growth of
methanogenic microorganisms had already started and, subsequently, the
increase rates of methane formation
were higher. As for the adjustment carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N),
values between 25.8:1 and 31.8:1 were found
to be suitable for biogas generation from the various substrates
examined in this study.

nitrogen ratio (C/N) on methane yield

As for the temperature and pH value profiles, these were similar in all
the three tests series. In terms of e.g. the
test series A, the profiles are shown in Figure 3. Here, the substrate
temperature was 32.3 ± 2.0 °C during the
entire experimental period. This corresponds to the mesophilic operating
conditions for which the reaction rate
is slow but more robust and stable than biogas production at
thermophilic conditions (Schnürer and Jarvis,
2009). Considering the pH, according to Rao et al. (2010) the optimal
efficiency of the methanogens is reached
within the pH range of 6.5–8.0, while in case of acetogens the
respective range is 5.0 – 8.5. Korres and Nizami
(2013), on the other hand, reported that the optimum operating pH range
for anaerobic digesters should be
between 7.0 and 8.5. Because the pH value fell sharply due to hydrolysis
and acidification at the beginning of
the tests, a total of 32 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate were added to
adjust the pH value between 6.0 and 7.6
in the course of the first 6 d. The formation of methane started after
48 d and took place mainly at the pH around
7.3 (see also Figure 4). Apart from that, Figure 4 also shows for the
test series A the corresponding cumulative
biogas and methane productions depending on the hydraulic retention
time. It can be seen that virtually no
methane was formed within the first 48 d (the generated biogas consisted
almost exclusively of carbon dioxide
and hydrogen). The fluctuating rate of methane formation in the
following 44 d was caused by repeated gas
sampling. The gas formation period ended after 92 d, during which 49.00
L of biogas and 20.46 L of methane
were formed. This corresponds to the methane concentration of 41.7
vol.%.

the substrate according to Table 1 (test
series A).

5. Conclusions

In this study, the conversion of pineapple solid wastes into energy-rich
biogas by means of laboratory-scale
anaerobic digestion was investigated. It was found that pineapple waste
has a high potential for biogas
production. The process parameters significantly influencing the
quantity and quality of biogas formation using
a semi-batch process were identified. The goal was to obtain the highest
possible methane yield from
the available pineapple waste, which was achieved using a digester
having the effective volume of 3 L and
a pineapple waste to cow dung ratio of 1:2.4. The resulting methane
yield was 113.8 L/kg ODM after the
hydraulic retention time of 92 d. The methane content of the produced
biogas ranged from 41.0 vol.%
to 70.5 vol.%. As for the feasibility of biogas technology in Togo, the
next steps are the scale-up of the obtained
laboratory results and the construction of a pilot plant. This low-cost
plant has already been manufactured and
is equipped with a 60 L digester able to treat substrate volumes of 50 –
55 L.
