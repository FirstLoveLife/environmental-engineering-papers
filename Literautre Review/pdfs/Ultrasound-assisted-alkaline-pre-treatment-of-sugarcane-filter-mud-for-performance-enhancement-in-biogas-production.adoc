Abstract: Sugar cane filter mud pre-treated by combined
ultrasound-alkaline pre-treatment at different NaOH loading rates +
(0.25%-6%) and pre-treatment time (5 min to 60 min) performed in batch
reactors under mesophilic conditions ((37±1)°C). +

Central composite design (CCD) was used to assess the effects on the
chemical oxygen demand (COD) solubilisation, volatile +

fatty acid (VFA) concentration and methane yield. All pre-treatments
were found significant (p<0.01) to enhance methane +

yield (up to 39.49%) compared to the untreated filter mud. In general,
results demonstrated the effectiveness of ultrasound +

assisted alkaline pre-treatment while increasing both NaOH loadings and
pre-treatment time. Pre-treatment also increased the +

CODs solubilisation as well as VFA concentration, the optimal Initial
CODs and VFA of 12 212 mg/L and 5830.97 mg/L, as +

determined by response surface methodology were noted on E9. Finally,
modified Gompertz model was applied successfully to +

study kinetic of biogas production data, and showed an excellent fit. +

The significant increase in energy utilization especially in +

the +
development of alternate fuels. One of the concepts used for +
recovering the energy is the biological degradation of organic +
wastes by anaerobic digestion for the generation of methane as a +

Cane straw left in the field after harvesting, bagasse, and filter
mud, +
bagasse and a small share of straw have already been used as solid +
fuel in cogeneration systems in general. Meanwhile, the filter +
mud has been completely unused from the energy point of view[2]. +

residual mud is a soft, semi-solid, dark brown to black colored +
material, composed of inorganic soil particles, residual sugars and +
small pieces of sugarcane bagasse. It contains 60%-85% moisture, +
fiber lignocellulose, crude protein, sugar, wax, fat and ash[4,5]. +
Usually, the filter mud spread on the field as fertilizer or sold as +
immature compost to farmers. However, this practice is not +
economically suitable and pollute the environment[6]. According +
to the characteristics mentioned, anaerobic digestion is a promising +
strategy to making use of filter mud for the production of biogas. +
Early studies have been report on the anaerobic digestion of filter +
mud[7]. Some researchers have also been made to produce the +
biogas from filter mud by mixing it with bagasse and other +
wastes[8,9]. +

lignocelluloses materials +

As filter mud contains a considerable amount of fibre, applying +
different pre-treatment is expected to be useful in making the +
substrate particles utilizable +
However, +
the enzymatic +
numerous pre-treatment methods based on +
hydrolysis of +
including physical, +
physicochemical, biological as well as chemical methods have been +
develop. Only a few studies have assessed the effects of different +
pre-treatment methods on methane production from filter mud[10-12]. +
To our knowledge, pre-treatment of filter mud by ultrasound +
assisted alkaline for biogas production in patch reactor has not been +
studied yet. +

Alkaline, usually employing NaOH, is known to break bond +
linkages between lignin in the lignocelluloses material, causing +
cellulose swelling which results in greater accessibility of the +
cellulose fraction[9]. At the same time, the sodium concentration +
of filter mud was found to be 8.15 mg/L which is very low than +

2 Materials and methods +

2.1 Substrate and inoculum +

Sugarcane filter mud obtained from a White Nile Sugar +
Company factory (WNSC) in the White Nile state, Sudan during +
the 2015/2016 season, dried and transported to China in sealed +
plastic bags and stored at 4oC until its use. The inoculum +
collected from an anaerobic digestion plant ‘Kaiping Family Farm, +
Poukou, Nanjing, China’ uses pig waste as substrate and adapted +
during two weeks to filter mud. The inoculum used in the tests +
contained 2.01% total solids (TS); 47.90% volatile solids (VS) and +
pH 7.76. +

2.2 Analytical methods +

to +

the procedures +

(FE20K, Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland) +

All analyses were duplicated, and the results given are mean +
values. TS, VS, ashes, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen +
(TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) +
were determined according +
in standard +
methods[18]. The pH was monitored in samples using digital pH +
meter +
capable of +
measurement in liquid substrates. Samples for analysis chemical +
oxygen demand solubilisation (CODs) and VFA were centrifuged +
at 10 000 r/min for 4 min in a centrifuge. After centrifugation, +
only the supernatant was used. VFA was determined by gas +
chromatography (GC-2014, Shimadzu, Japan), having a column of +
(DA, 30 m × 0.53 mm × 1 µm Stabilwax) and flame ionization +
detector (FID), while injector and detector temperature was 150°C +
and 240°C respectively. The CH4 content measurement was +
conducted through biogas sampling from reactors by a special +
syringe and injection to the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) of +
a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) equipped with PQ 80-100 +
Mesh column. The operation condition was: 25 mL/min He as the +
carrier gas, detector temperature 250°C and 90°C of column +
temperature. +
The % CODs removal was calculated as a +
percentage between initial and final CODs. +
2.3 Pre-treatment conditions +

The pre-treatment process was conducted on a 1 L glass ﬂask. +

Filter mud (48 g TS) was pre-soaked in a NaOH solution at room +
temperature for 15 min, solid to liquid ratio was 1:8 and treated +
with ultrasound by using a probe sonicate (HC-SHL-800, Zhejiang, +
China). The operating frequency and power were 28 kHz and +
440 W, respectively. The ultrasonic irradiation was transferred +
through a titanium cylindrical horn 2 cm diameter, introduced into +

the ﬂask through the side neck and submerged 1.0 cm into the +
mixture. The temperature was controlled using a water bath. +
Different conditions of NaOH loading (0.25%, 1.09%, 3.13%, +
5.16% and 6%) and pre-treatment time (5 min, 13.05 min, 32.5 min, +
51.95 min and 60 min) were used according to a CCD setup in +
Table 1 (empty cells not tested in the CCD). After pre-treatment, +
the pre-treated filter mud slurry was neutralized with hydrochloric +
acid and immediately used for subsequent biochemical methane +
potential test. +

methodology was used to evaluate the optimum response regions of +
CODs and to optimize the corresponding variables. The CCD for +
two factors utilized in the study, presented in Table 1. A total of +
22 experimental runs including eight tests for factorial points, eight +
tests for axial points, also, six center points were included along
the +
experimental blocks to provide orthogonality and to estimate the +
experimental error[19]. The effect of two pre-treatment operating +
variables NaOH concentration (x1) and pre-treatment time (x2) on +
the two response variables, COD solubilisation, and VFA was +
determined. +

2.5 Anaerobic digesters +

 +

The anaerobic digestion experiments for measuring methane +
potentials from untreated and pre-treated filter mud were carried +
out in 1 L bottles used as batch reactors, sealed with two holes +
rubber stoppers. The total working volume was 800 mL, with 6% +
TS concentrations. The bottles were filled in with the slurry of +
treated filter mud sample about 400 mL and complete the volume +
to 800 mL with the inoculum, which met an inoculum to substrate +
ratio of about 1:1 in volume basis. One of the holes in the rubber +
stopper was used to withdrawal sludge sample to analyze the +
process parameters during anaerobic digestion, and the second hole +
was connected with the water bottle through a pipe having a port +
for taking gas samples for GC analysis. Biogas production was +
measured by water displacement technique which the water was +
saturated with a brine solution that was prepared with 10% NaCl +
(w/v) to minimize the dissolution of produced gasses from the +
reactor. +
The pH of the substrate after ultrasound-alkaline +
pre-treatments was found to be higher than 10. It was adjusted +
one time before starting fermentation in 7.0-8.0 by using HCl. +

2.7 Statistical analyses +

All the experiments were conducted by a set of conditions +
provided through Deign Expert v7. Two-way analysis of variance +
(ANOVA) was used to test significant differences in mean values +
for the response variables CODs, VFA and G(t). Furthermore, the +
data sets were analyzed, and graphical representation was provided +
by using Analytical Software package (Graph Pad, Prism 6.01.) +
with a confidence interval of 95%. +

3 Results and discussion +

3.1 Characteristics of the substrate +

Filter mud used as a substrate for biogas production in this +
study was analyzed for TS, VS, and TOC, pH, TN and sodium +
contents (Table 2). The moisture content for new sample varied +
from 54.9% to 58.6% (averaging 56.7%). Dry filter mud +
contained TS and VS values (95.90% and 45.33% of TS). +
Depends on the cane variety, soil conditions, and nutrients applied +
in the field, the process of clarification adopted by WNSC and +
other environmental +
filter mud contains various +
micro-nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous (3.09 g/kg and +
0.87%), respectively. The organic matter equal to 239.53 g/kg. +
TOC content was higher in comparing to nitrogen, which leads to +
C/N ratio of 44.95 greater than the optimal value recommended for +
anaerobic digestion (20-40)[21]. The pH of filter mud slurry before +
pre-treatment was 5.77. +

filter mud were tested to study the effects of pre-treatment (NaOH +

3.2.1 COD solubilization and removal +

The behavior for CODs values was examined deeply during +
the anaerobic digestion process after each three days interval, as +
shown in Figure 1. In all cases, values for CODs had shown +
increasing pattern than the CODs for untreated filter mud, due to +
the effect of pre-treatment in changing the composition of hardly +
degradable compounds and increase the biodegradable CODs. At +
the beginning of the experiments, the filter mud was hydrolysed +
with high strength adapted inoculum, this hydrolysed substrate +
further acidified and converted into CH4 and CO2 with the help of +
methanogens. The initial COD values ranged between 6152 +
mg/L and 11 576 mg/L, in comparison with 5100 mg/L for the +
control. The highest initial COD solubilisation reached in the +
current work was obtained for reactor E9, resulting in an increase +
of 58.24% with respect to untreated filter mud. Lowest +
solubilisation were found with E1, E2, E3 and E4 reactors. the +
initial COD values were 6152 mg/L, 6912 mg/L, 6232 mg/L and +
6336 mg/L, respectively, which is in accordance with previous +
studies conducted by Jank et al.[12], who found that, the lower +
NaOH concentration did not show any improvement COD release +
from filter mud. +
level of COD +
concentration started to decrease since the first day of the +
fermentation process as shown in Figure 1. +

Generally speaking, +

the +

Futhermore, the COD removal efficiency of all pre-treatments +
and control presented in Table 3. As the results-oriented, the % of +
COD removal in all the treatments increased at different rates, the +
highest COD removal of 87.69% was observed for E7 reactors +
while the least was 69.88% for untreated filter mud. +

Higher levels of delignification (80%) have been reported at a +
NaOH concentration of 1 N, paper loading of 0.5% (w/v), +
sonication power of 100 W[16]. During the combination of +
alkaline and ultrasonic pre-treatment of sewage sludge, the COD +
solubilisation was increased from 1200 mg/L to 11 000 mg/L after +
such treatment[22]. The ratio of soluble COD to total COD was +
increased from 47% in raw leachate to 63% after 45 min sonication +
at 600 W/L[23]. Cellulose content was also increased by the +

variation remained unexplained by the quadratic model. +
3.2.2 VFA concentration +

VFAs are important mid-products in the production of methane, +
and their concentrations affect in methanogenic population, pH +
fluctuation, and anaerobic digestion efficiency. To address these +
effects, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, iso-butyric acid, +
valeric acid and iso-valeric acid were intensely observed at each +
three days interval of the whole digestion period. Figure 3 +
presented the VFAs concentration level. In the first ten days of +
the digestion, all reactors showed the highest VFAs production. +
Maximum VFA was recorded for reactor E9 on the 10th day of +
digestion that was 5830.97 mg/L while least TVFAs, 300.96 mg/L +
belonged to the E3 reactor as showed in Figure 3, these VFAs +
degraded and consumed by methanogens to produce more than +
81% of the total methane generated during whole digestion period. +
In the first week of digestion, acetic acid production was higher +
than the other acids, but on the 10th day of digestion, propionic +
acid concentration was found increasing rapidly, which affect +
negatively in the anaerobic digestion process, and the total methane +
yield consequently became very low (<5 mL). Another study +
showed that, when the propionic acid concentration was increased +
to 900 mg/L, significant inhibition effect on methanogenic bacteria +
growth appeared, these effects resulted in the accumulation of +
ethanol and VFAs, and the total methane yield consequently +
became very low[24]. +

 +
Figure 1 COD concentration profile at different time periods of +

anaerobic digestion process +

 +

The CCD of RSM was used to evaluate the effect of ultrasound +
time and NaOH loading on initial CODs (Figure 2). The +
mathematical regression for initial CODs as a function of NaOH +
loading (A) and sonication time (B) was obtained as follows: +

(3) +

The ANOVA of the quadratic equations for CODs was used to +
determine the adequacy and significance (Table not shown), which +
indicated that the interactive model term is insignificant (p>0.05). +
The main first-order effects of the independent variables A (NaOH +
loading) and B (ultrasound time) had a positive effect on initial +
CODs, with factor A exhibiting the highest effect on the response +
and more significant than their respective quadratic effects. +

 +

 +

3.2.3 Biogas and methane production +

period +

All pre-treatments of filter mud used in the present study had +
significantly increased methane production (p<0.01) as compared +
with the untreated filter mud, daily methane production and +
cumulative methane yield were shown in Figure 4, respectively. +
Methane yield increased by 39.49% from untreated filter mud for +
pre-treatments E9, followed by E5 with 36.49% methane enhancing +
capability. There is a significant difference between the results +
obtained by the highest pre-treatments (E5 and E9) compared to the +
untreated reactor. The best pre-treatment is, therefore, E5, +
because fewer reagents as well as less pre-treatment time are +
required. Methane production by the remainder other pre-treated +
reactors found significant to enhance the methane, but not +
significant when compared with each other (Table 3). +

To our knowledge, combined ultrasound-alkaline pre-treatment +
of filter mud has not yet been reported. Ultrasound alone +
pre-treatment has been extensively studied to increase biogas yield +
from waste activated sludge[25]. Recently, several studies have +
been conducted on the use of ultrasound to pretreat lignocellulosic +
biomass and other wastes for biogas production; it was shown +

 +

Figure 2 Response surface plot for the effect of NaOH loading (A) +

and ultrasound time (B) +

 +

RSM was made to optimize the process parameters for +
maximizing the CODs. +
Point optimization for CODs was +
attempted with Design Expert version 7.0, which predicted the +
highest yields of CODs equivalent to 14 072.3 mg/L after +
enzymatic hydrolysis of the filter mud pre-treated with 6% of +
NaOH in the presence of ultrasound for 49.19 min. +

The correlation coefficient (R2) value determines the quality of +
the quadratic model. The value of R2 is always between 0 and 1. +
It is known that the R2 value greater than 0.75 indicates the +
accuracy of the model. The R2 and the adjusted correlation +
coefficient (R2 adj.) for the model were 0.9913 and 0.9884 +
respectively, which indicated that only less than 1% of the total +

3.3 Kinetic study using Gompertz model +

Biogas production from anaerobic digestion of treated and +
untreated filter mud was modeled based on modified Gompertz +
equation. The results of a kinetic study for an experiment using +
the modified Gompertz model were given in Table 4, which +
indicated that the modified Gompertz equation can be used to +

and duration of lag phase. To evaluate the model, the predicted +
cumulative biogas values were plotted against the measured values, +
as shown in Figure 4b. The lag phase’s λ was calculated to be in +
between 0.07 d and 1.37 d, because of the adapted inoculum added, +
and +
the +
pre-treated filter mud. The RMSE value fell within the range of +
2.086-5.458 and the R2 value fell within the range of 0.9798-0.9946. +
The difference between the predicted and measured methane yields +
was in the range of 0.67%-10.86%. Thus, the modified Gompertz +
model was found to have the better fit to the experimental data for +
all reactors used in this study. +

4 Conclusions +

Filter mud was found to be a potential substrate for biogas +
production. The combined alkaline and ultrasonic treatment, with +
different NaOH loading and pre-treatment times, were applied to +
enhance the anaerobic biodegradability of filter mud. Parameters +
like methane production, VFA, and CODs were monitored during +
digestion. 39.49% increase in methane yield from untreated filter +
mud was obtained. +
the COD +
solubilisation as well as VFA concentrations. Hence, it was +
possible to increase methane production through the combination +
of ultrasound and alkaline pre-treatment followed by subsequent +
enzymatic hydrolysis. +
